1,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"I'm scared and hearing creepy voices.  So I'll pause for a moment and write a review while I wait for my heart beat to return to atleast somewhat calmer times.  This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door.",1
2,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Best game, more better than Sam Pepper's YouTube account. 10/10What you'll need to play:A computerSome extra pants.Pros:Scary as hell.Fun.Adventure.Spooky.Did I forgot to mention that its scary as hell?You'll get more pants/briefs in your wardrobe.Time consuming if you're bored.Cons:Buying pants/briefs. You haven't downloaded it yet.",1
3,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"A littly iffy on the controls, but once you know how to play, very easy to master. I've made it to floor 1000 before, but due to certain circumstances was unable to finish. Was not game related, don't worry, not a bug/glitch or antyhing.I highly recommend this for casual play, maybe with a friend or two watching. Hilarity ensues, especially once you hit floor 150. Have fun my fellow fleshlings!",1
4,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Great game, fun and colorful and all that.A side note, though: When are we getting windowed mode? My computer hates fullscreen so.... yeah. The computer doesn't like to run this. Shame, because this is really enjoyable. But until then, I guess I'll settle for more Skyrim. Cheers!",1
5,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Not many games have the cute tag right next to the horror tag on Steam.I first played this game in late 2014 and coming back to it for the first time since. This game is so good for it being free, take advantage and experience it. Try and get to  room 1000 or as close as you can. The further you progress the darker the game becomes.",1
6,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewIt's pretty cute at first, but then later gets horrifying and it really does jumpscare! The specimen scared me more! Still enjoyable and worth playing, though. Great and well-made game!10/10",1
7,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,Great game. it's a cute little horror game that progressively gets darker and scarier. It has a sense of humor too! (I've played it a little but I have watched several people play it and I love it!),1
8,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a Free Retro maze game with jump scares and death.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  I took a wrong turn somehow and keep getting killed by a ghostly creature around room 61, i guess i need to restart and take a different route.  Has a retro look, sort of like Castle Wolfenstein or Doom.   Has creepy music and sounds.  It has 1,000 rooms to go through.  Try this game, you might like it.For more info:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mKsY6rVdDohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3olm3IprwQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZEJVpaRhkIhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/4/27/8502907/spookys-house-of-jump-scares-gameplay-overview-videohttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/14/spookys-house-of-jump-scares-free-game/#more-340713http://www.indiedb.com/games/spookys-house-of-jump-scares/reviewshttp://www.bagogames.com/spookier-meets-eye-spookys-house-jump-scares-review/ ",1
9,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Somewhere between light hearted, happy parody and being afraid of the dark lies Spooky's House of Jump Scares. You are tasked with the daunting duty of surviving one thousand rooms in this endless first person perspective runner. Each room is no more than a few seconds thanks to a sprint key and the fact that each door counts as a new room. Even then one thousand rooms is still a feat against tedium and needless repetition. There are still things every fifteen or so rooms to keep your interest and at the end of fifty rooms you'll find a save point, but nothing can save you from permanent death at the hands of the foul creatures that live within.On the surface the game has a clean, chipper almost cartoon low budget charm to it. Jump scares are rare and at first it comes in the form of adorable cardboard cutouts of pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons that pop out of the wall accompanied by a sound. Some of the sounds are silly and unfitting other times its screeches to drive chills down your spine. The game excels in the sound department and makes good use of music, ambient sounds and foot steps following you.As you delve deeper through the doors of this dank dungeon, you'll uncover more frightening things and points of intreege. There are plenty of written notes here and there. A few times you'll need to search for a key in a different room, but the other ninety-nine percent of the game is leaving rooms behind forever.The themes of the rooms begin to change from the mundane almost Wolfenstien 3D-esque corridors to metal asylum rooms that give you a flashlight to find your way through. There are purple dungeons, green sewers with glowing scum. Some rooms are coated with slime to slow you own while others have holes in the ceiling as if to give you a feeling of dread that something could pop out.There are a limited amount of rooms and I started to memorize them all. Even the game's crescendo encounters in a vacant room with walkways. There's no way to fall into the dark chasms, it acts as if they were walls, but with this open room you get to see a specific creature that might be following you. Sometimes they can float over the gaps, other times they're stuck trying to walk at you from across the gap so you can get a good look at them when they're harmless.If they touch you three or so times you're dead. You have health that does replenish over time and these big moments are rare and easy to avoid. Just keep running and hope there are no locked doors! They only happen in specific rooms and sometimes the rooms are empty, but it still gives that dreadful feeling.You can tear through these rooms pretty quick about 350 of them in a 45 minute. Your stamina will deplete to give a monster the chance to catch you, but going through a door restores your will to run. Other than that waiting a few seconds will replenish your stamina. Longer rooms hav1e limited visibility. The further out an area is the darker it gets.A few rooms have good diversions or tricks to them. Such as one that turns bright and you need to enter the correct combination of corridors signaled by chimes until you can see the door. Another room is endless darkness with a torch at the end, until its revealed that the torch is merely painted on a black wall. A few times you'll need to search an adjacent room for a key to the one you're in.Every fifty rooms, you take a moment to unwind in an elevator that reminds you to hang in there or have a coffee break. The game makes a good balance of calm moments for each of the few tense situations. Its what keeps you off kilter and never expecting anything. Every two hundred and fifty rooms offers a prize to you. What's in the box? Is it snakes? Is it a jack-in-the-box or is it a note?Truth be told I'm very goal oriented with video games and so Spooky missed its mark for me. The cardboard cutouts get in the way. Being chased by something means that it was no threat since it was already behind me. Perhaps in later rooms it gets more difficult, but this is just easy tedium.  Another room, another room, another room. Then knowing I have seven hundred more rooms and another two hour investment of endless running turns the game into a grind. There's no fear and its too long to endure even with save points. The game reuses its points of interest a few times since it recycles rooms.Another issue I have with the game is getting stuck on edges where I need to push away from a wall to get free and turn a corner. Its more than walls, its on the gaps too. I suppose this is acceptable for a scary game where you get chased, but I'm hung up on these hang ups.One interesting thing the game does have is a stabbing mini game where it looks like you're a ghost in a mall. Its a good diversion from the repetition. There's even a computer that shows you all the creatures in the house. Well most of them at least.The best selling point this game has is that its free. By no means does that make this a good game, but it makes it easier to accept. Its a game that brings you up with charm to tear you down with scares beyond the cheap cardboard cutouts that can litter a hallway every so often. Its just far too repetitive without that much dread or excitement.",0
10,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"This game with its cute little out of the wall pop-ups that scared the living light out of me I like it very much I haven't played it lately but this is a very good game, I like how its a funny jump scare game and it is very very fun but the story is pretty sad. so good luck and have fun in the rooms :D",1
11,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,Early Access ReviewI thought this game would be fun and cute. Never have I been so wrong.There's a room with a computer with 'Cat-Dos' operating system making the experience 705949% more chilling than it originally was.Play this game - not a very romantic idea.,1
12,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewGreen ghosty goo thing chases me, not that scary, until I turn around and he's suddenly behind me.I die.I get scared by a tree stump and some pumpkins on the wall.I die.AND THEN SOME â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PUPPET GUY FROM MAJORA'S MASK COMES ALONG, AND STABS A FRICKING NEEDLE IN MY EYE.I DIE.THIS IS NOT ROMANTIC AT ALL.",1

14,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewGreat game.  It always has you running paniced and confused, it makes the horror experience complete.  With jumpscares and a confusing but compelling story mystery you just can't pull away from this game.",1
15,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"The name says it all, but don't get fooled by the seemingly ""normal"" title of the game. You'll know it when you play it.Any person who plays this game(including me) has the right to say that this free horror entertainment is ""2spooky4me"". ",1
16,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,Never would have thought something so adorably cute would make me dirty my clothing in such short time.Great simple game where the fear builds up just awaiting for the next screamer on the corner. Plus it's free! Can't go wrong with that.,1
17,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"First, get hugged by cardboard cut outs, then get chased by freaky as hell ghouls, after you finnaly escape, you will always be on your toes. Watch out, and beware.......                      YES/10",1
18,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,It's exactly what you think it is. Progress through 1000 rooms of horror in cute style with lots of references to popular creepypastas and games. Definitely worth checking out. And it's free! What else do you need for positive experience? :D,1
19,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"This game is awesome! It may seem cute and not scary but trust me its scary af! The first 50 rooms are just cute but from room 60 it will just get more and more scary! This is a really great horror game and also it is free! I really think you should give this game a shot if you like to be spooked, if you do not wish to get really >>>>>>> scared I suggest you do not play this game! The first specimen is cute but the rest are really scary and also they will try to kill you and hunt you! Like I said, awesome horror game! If you want a cute game this is not what you are looking for!",1
20,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,Just played this game for about an hour and it has given me some pretty good scares... T_T Few silly jumps starting but as the game progresses it's harder to avoid the paranoia and tension XDIt's fun indeed :),1
21,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"This game may seem cute, adorble and innocent at first. With the cute scary pop's outs every now and again. I was glad to see a spooky scary skeleton.. But things got a little dark when there was notes laying around and a demon like ghost following you where ever you go until a certian point that is. Not to memtion that there are some dead-ends and tons of spooks. If you're into horror running away types. You might like this. Dispite it being looking like it was made for kids when it wasn't. I'd say 11/12 maybe?But all in all. I enjoy it. It's not alone in the dark or any other scary horror like that. It's as the title says: Spooky's House of Jump Scares. And oh boy, I'm pretty spooked. And I'm not joking. This game actually gave me goosebumps.",1
22,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Those puppets, man! They freak me out! Can't get away from the evil puppets!!! Then again, I might just suck. Great freebie though. Don't let the childish appearance and graphics fool you. This is indeed a horror game. And not a bad one at that if I say so myself. Play it!",1
23,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis Game is a bit simple but over all i like it, i've currently reached room 710 as its the farthest this game is currently developed to, as its still being built.its a survival horror game that involves roaming a house with many rooms, i think it merges cute, and scary very well as the cute aspects are not out of place nor are the scary aspects they fit supprisingly well and it's amazing how  under the right criteria the cute pop up scares can acctualy be a effective jump scare.i also quite enjoyed the easter eggs and nods to (alien), (alice in wonderland), (five nights at freddy's)  and who knows what other easter eggs will be added as the game progresses, all in all i give this game 7/10 stars.",1
24,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"One of the best horror games imo. It's free, it's cute and it's ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. At the beggining it's just cute jump scare here, cute jump scare there, open doors and it you start thinking, well, this isn't so bad, I guess. But after your first real horror encounter you began to feel chased everywhere you go. And the cute jump scares are not cute anymore. You know something is after you, and begin questioning wether to continue on or not, but you know that you must. I highly recommend it. It's free, so what are you waiting for? It will be a very pleaseant experience, trust me on that.",1
25,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Cute and Horror do not really mesh well in so many instances in gaming. This is one of those delightful exceptions, even if that's because the cuteness at first is then outshone by genuinly horrible things hunting you.  The 'Jumpscares' in the title comes from cheerful little carnival haunted house-style, wooden, pop up monsters that will appear starting early on.  The real horrors are more of the 'you can't fight it, just learn how it moves and strikes, and try to get away'.  This does not, however, in any way mean the funhouse pop up monsters stop showing up; even if you got used to them before, you are quite likely to get a startle when one springs up in front of you while you're distracted fleeing some lurking abomination.",1
26,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"great game for your kids!when your childerent play this game, they learn true important things! like how ghost shouldent be trustedand generator make things bright! but most importantly teaches them math from all those rooms!i highly sugest it for childeren 5-10",1
27,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewAn interesting and quirky experience for me. Almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next, of which there are 1000, some short and straighforward, some longer and more complex, but all being a few seconds long at most. Occasionally, you'll be chased by monsters which, despite coming in many variations, almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit. Very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed, giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to. Because of these characteristics, the game feels like a very long chase sequence and, with 1000 rooms to be overcome before the game is over, it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game, clocking at around 3 hours for completion. Fortunately, there are save spots every 50 (later 100) rooms, which allows the player to take a break if necessary. Difficulty-wise, it's not hard; almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle, and it's entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms. However, the game leaves little room for error, as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one-hit kill you if they manage to get in close enough. It all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door. In regards to atmosphere, it's a blend of humor/cuteness with horror, which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots. The humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue, which are peppered throughout the gameplay (but become increasingly rarer). The horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds, most of them from the monsters that chase you, and I didn't find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor, so I believe the game was successful in its atmosphere. In my opinion, that is the highest point of this game - seeing what monsters, environments and dialogue will come next.All in all, if you're a fan of horror games, I'd say give this at least a try. It's different and has a charm to it that I believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique.",1
28,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Starts off rather harmless and cute, and very quickly takes a turn for dark and disturbing. It's not without it's faults, the ending is sort of a let down, and it doesn't really escalate as well as it could.That said, by all means check this game out, especially as its free.and watch out for the skeletonsthey'll get you",1
29,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Good, but you need much more than the minimum to run above 20 FPS. I got to room 10 before I got tired of it glitching the loading system for the game it was so laggy and chopping up ALL of the sounds. Not for those without a pretty decent PC.",1
30,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"At first everything seems alright, just gotta make it through 1000 rooms with nothing but carboard cut outs right?WRONGWhen I first started, it was fine and dandy, screamed when a cute ghost popped out until I found a green puddle.I read a note, turned around, and then a green demon sent from the deepest pits of hell began chasing me and I stumble through the next fifty rooms in blind terror.The lesson we learned today isNEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE AGAIN",1
31,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,- Was disappointed with lack of options- Got bored while running empty hallways- Music started making me a bit uneasy- first cardboard ghost made me jump a little- oh crap! why are the walls turning into blood?- oh crap! shes got a knife!10/10 would crap my pants again,1
32,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"This game is incredible. Despite the title, the initial appearance of the game isn't that of a horror title, even the first scares that you come across are cutely designed cardboard cutouts that pop out from walls as you walk by. As you progress, the game truly comes into its own, changing the scenery, music and overall atmosphere to continually put you in a state of unease. With a whole host of ""specimens"" trying to scare/kill you, an adorable antogonist, outstanding sound and an ability to deliver an unnerving experience (not to mention the fact that this game is free) should put ths game way up on the lists of anyone looking for a decent horror game.",1
33,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"When I first started, I was like is this a joke? Later on itgot creepy and then when i see thae happy mask salesman from majora's mask, I was like nope.avi. Toatly worth the game, but what I don't understand why the dlc is not free",1
34,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Spooky's House of Jumpscares is a horror game, no sense beating around the bush. Although it pretends to be a mockery of games that rely on jumpscares for the first fifty or so rooms, things quickly take a turn for the sinister...The game is not long at all; going through the 1,000 rooms is not as tedious of a task as it seems, as each room can be ran through easily within 6 seconds, slightly more for ""special"" rooms.Gameplay is rather simple: Get to the end of Spooky's maze, and survive whatever lies in the bowels of her home. New monsters are introduced every 75 rooms or so, and after the initial chase sequence, can begin chasing you again at any time through your perilious adventure, always keeping things tense. Special rooms and notes can be found throughout the mansion, hinting at a bigger picture behind Spooky and her house...There are two endings, giving you a reason to play through the story at least twice. If obtaining a high score is your cup of tea, you can try your luck in Endless Mode, which challenges you to go as far as possible into the mansion, with monsters, many new, many old, making an appearance.The DLC, Karamari Hospitial, adds even more horror, with a shorter campaign, five new monsters to avoid, and tons of little secrets to hunt down.I highly recommend this game. Also, check out the HD remaster if you like this game! It adds even more stuff to Spooky's twisted home.",1
35,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"This little gem is absolutely pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly terrifying. How? I hear you cry. Surely because of the cutesy graphics it couldn't possibly be scary. Right? WRONG. DEAD WRONG. Ahem. The soft graphics are what the game uses to lull you into a false sense of security. After gaining your trust the game begins piling on the atmosphere like a dumptruck at a...dumptruck convention(?) After the first 50-100 rooms or so it becomes clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares aren't the only thing plagueing you as you journey through what quickly becomes a monstrous hellscape born out of your own nightmares. The game also nods and pays homage to most genres of horror and even references some popular horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil. The game isn't very long but if you're a coward like me then you'll only be able to play it in short, 200 room bursts.  If you're bored and looking for a sp00ky time then pick up Spooky's House of Jump Scares and prepare to spend a lot of money on new underwear because trust me, you'l need them.",1
36,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"I enjoy many types of games, but horror is my favorite genre, and as such I tend to be more critical of games that claim to be scary. If you had told me yesterday that a game could be scary, cute, clever and funny - and succeed on all 4 fronts - I may have guffawed at you. But I'm currently taking a breather in room 400/1000 and to date, I've had approximately 31 small heart attacks and twice as many chuckles. I'd certainly have paid $20 for this, since it's free you have no excuse not to try it.",1
37,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Oh, a cute ""horror"" game, perfect for a late night relaxing gaming...Oh #@&!... ok, it's just a cardboard. Ok, move on, move on, nothing to fear.Oh #@&! somethings following me, #@&! #@&! #@&! !!!! TINY CARBOARD NOOO!!!Never ever ever thought I will sh*t myself from a cadboard ghost. PROS:+You will learn to wash your own pants in no time+carboard ghosts+ for a free to play game it's a great game, simple but funCONS:-You have a long road ahead of you, if you can't wash your own pants yetIt's a must play if on sale... wait, it's free? Then it's a must play+ :)",1
38,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"I have to say this is the scariest free game I've ever played. Jump scares are my weakness to be fair, but something seems just really creepy about this game, despite the cute and unrealistic canvas the gameplay is painted on. Sure, the graphics aren't great and the controls are a little off, but this game still has creeped me out to the point where I need a break every once in awhile. Maybe its the story being told or the atmosphere, either way, this game does a good job doing what a lot of PAID games fail to do. Actually SCARE the player. I thought the pop outs were cute and funny until I was running for my life and they decided to get me while I wasn't focused on them. Anyways, this game is extremely good for the low price of nothing so get it if you like horror genre or just want to try something different.",1
39,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Well I had tons of fun with this game! Right up until the end... v_v The game had a fantastic ending gameplay and some cool enemies and such. But...My audio crapped out! It was so horrible it was nothing but static, which totally took away all of the spookyness.In the case of Spooky's, without the audio, was boring. Didn't help that the audio turned into static also. However I went and watched Markiplier and other various Youtubers play the game. It was great! ^_^ a perfect ending to a perfect game. 10/10 would play again. (if audio is fixed)",1
40,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Saw this on a famous youtube gaming channel and thought to give it a shot.Believe me it is scarier than it sounds and definitely scarier than what it first seems.Concept is simple- you walk through rooms, trying to reach the end, bu things get more tense as you go on.Still haven't beat it. Keep dying at the same spot :(Anyways, if you like indie horror games, you might wanna check it out.",1
41,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"I think the dev did some research on objects that can scare humans. You may not like the style of the graphics but this game is the creepiest horror game I have ever played. All of the sound effects can scare you (especially the cardboard). In different level, different monsters will chase you which makes the game more and more creepy. Therefore, ignore the style of graphics and download the game. I am sure you won't regret trying it although you may regret trying it because it is VERY SCARY GAME. For all horror lovers, download it now!Tips: If you are too scared, turn off speaker and play.",1

43,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"This is a game that parodies various horror tropes, yet manages to be sacrier than most horror games on the market (I'm looking at you, Five Nights at Freddy's series). When you do that, you get all of my praise, and you even get a moveset made for your main antagonist: http://sandvich33.deviantart.com/art/SSB-moveset-Spooky-570789553 ",1
44,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Has to be one of my favorite free to play games yet. I went in thinking I could handle this game, but unfortunately I was incorrect. This awesome game scared the crap out of me and at some points made me laugh too. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys exploring creepy old mansions where no one returns when entering.",1
45,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"It's a very short game and definitely worth the time. Some of the bosses are really tedious and you're suddenly running and just trying to get to the next checkpoint before you die. The jump scares were really fun, because I played this with someone that jumped basically every time. If you're not the type to fall for those, then there will only be a really few/insanely creepy moments. Would play again, probably gonna get the DLC during the summer sale",1
46,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016," A great game! As the title suggests, it's full of jumpscares, I can't describe how fun this game is to play with a friend who's just as afraid of horror as you are.  Pros: Free Addictive Fun to play alone in the dark or with friends in the dark. Cons: Kinda short ",1
47,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,Early Access Reviewthis game is great its starts out cute and funny and gives you the cute jumpscares of cardboard cut outs so you feel safe but then it gets creepy and im not spoiling it but just download it with out watching videos its great oh and its FREE!                                                              GET NOW!!!!!!!!!!,1
48,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewSpooky's House of Jump Scares is worth your time. Being free (as of this review), this is the only benchmark the game has to pass. If it's worth your money, and worth your time, you should play it. While I have very little experience in the horror genre, Spooky's House of Jump Scares is pretty transparent with its premise. There's plenty of cute and lighthearted moments, some jump scares, and a thin thread of plot which goes deeper than the surface level. There are 1000 rooms, so you'll spend most of your time wandering from room to room, taking less than a second to move through one of the many repeated corridors. And, while the enemies are spaced out well enough to keep you interested, they can sometimes be a bit underwhelming. However, there are a couple of genuinely scary moments, and the game has enough charm that you may want to stick around to see it all.If you're looking for simple jump scares this game has you covered, and if you're interested in some horror game mechanics in a boiled-down scenario, check it out.",1
49,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access Reviewto ensure my sanity, every time a card boardcut out pops up i run in t it and kiss it. but bout the game, i would ay that it is one of the scariest games i have ever seen. i would give it a 10/10. but if you have heart problems or u are easily scared i recomend that u deffinitly do NOT play this game",1
50,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"This game is basically trying to tell us that jumpscares are really creepy, no matter if they are a creepy face like the one in the ""scary maze game"", or a ♥♥♥♥ing cute pumpkin. You just walk around from room to room and then, suddenly, a ♥♥♥♥ing cardboard with a cute slime appears in your face and BOOM, you need new pants. Well, it becomes really scary when some creepy dead ladies want to eat you and start following you forever. My advice in this situation is to never look back, just run for your life, and try not to stop and scream at some little cute ghost cardboards. Have fun :)",1
51,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"This is an okay-ish game, it\'s really boring in the beginning, it\'s pretty creepy. It\'s pretty fun!!

55,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"This game has a lot of endearing charm to it. The game manages to be both adorable and threateing at the same time. Admittedly, most of my scares from this game have actually come from really unthreatening things like cups of coffee and pieces of toast, but it goes to show that atmosphere plays a key role in horror, and that you don't need to actually be scary when you have a person on edge.",1

61,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"I wouldn't necesarily say I recomend this game fully. The gameplay is very basic, progression from going room to room gets old, and it's not the most terrifying game to hardened horror fanatics. But, if you got some time to kill, it's a fun distraction in short bursts.The game is very emersive. The ambience is very well done, the sound design alone really makes you feel like you're trapped miles below ground in a endless maze. The humor is very entertaining and quirky, which is probably the strongest point of the game. The ""jumpscares"" in the name sake aren't the main point of horror. Instead, they're really kind of the joke of the game. When a real threat shows up, it actually doesn't resort to jumpscares. And the monsters are varried enough to keep it suspensful when you're locked in a chase.The only downside, once again, is that it can get old really fast. Basically you just walk room to room. Every now and then you'll read some notes that parody the ones in other cliche horror games. And the jumpscares get more and more sillier. But, sometimes it can feel like a real chore to play this game during long periods. And I have no real interest to go back and find out how to get the good ending, nor do I really want to spend any money for the DLC. But, all in all, it's kind of fun to switch on every now and then when I want something spooky, but not too spooky.",1
62,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"i really appreciate that this game is free. most of the amazing games i've played are super expensive, and the fact that this is free blows my mind. it has a lot of features and stuff ^-^",1

No?Then you have to play this!!Well watch out because it'll be getting scarier and scarier after Room 100Things that you'll fear after playing this- Green ooze on the floor- Clicking noises behind you- Narrow & long hallway- Japanese schools (and Kyuubey obviously)- Cryaotic's face A backstabber (like some friends.. haha)- Oh dear god no! You'll never see the same way is it was before, dear (Pun intended)- McD (Probably it's a good thing xD) with 100% Beef and McNope!- Never run out of stamina- Sound of splashing waterIt's free!

64,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,This game may not be the most scariest but it does have a good way of jump scaring you like them cardboard cut outs O_O*The game is alot of fun to play and almost all of the 1000 rooms are in random orders you can play though the game again and come across different monsters at different times so it mixes things up on each play through.Their is a nice variety of monsters in the game and alot of them do different things to try and kill you.This game has a bit of a funny story to go along with all the spooks.The sounds in the game are very good even better with headphones.Overall this game is alot of fun and i think anyone who likes to play horror games should give this game a try i think you would enjoy it. The art style of the game is fits very well and i recommend using headphones it will make it even more fun.I would give this game a 9.5/10 or even 10/10 ,1

67,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI keep rushing thinking I'm going to be dead for staying in a room for so long. For one room, I was supposed to check out the slimy thing that slows you down.Then the green man came for me. I nearly died.Great game. The graphics is charming in its own way, and the jumpscares are numerous. From cardboard flaps to 2D man, they will give you a scare. Don't be fooled by how cute it looks at first. Surprisingly, it gives you the horror.I would definitely play this some more. Truth is though, I'm easily scared. So I keep rushing to the nearest door. When I got to the PC part (Cat-DOS was it?), I didn't read everything because I thought by the time I do and exit the program, I'll be dead.I wish I had balls of steel.",1
68,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"To start with, I would like to make two things perfectly clear. First, I hate jump scares. They live up to their name, and they scare me. Second, I don't really care for ""Lets Play"" videos. With that said, something about all the positive feedback this game has received made me want to play it. Hey, as a certain multi-holiday musical once told us ""Life's no fun without a good scare"". So I tried it, and was not disappointed. The jump scares were so good I Noped out after the second ""Specimen"". I then promptly pulled a Lets Play video, because I desperately wanted to see the rest of the game. Now, I plan on going back and facing my fears, because I want to play through the rest.This game blends cutesy artwork and characters with horror in an amazing way. Not to mention the obvious references and homages to other Horror games (and a few other fun references as well). It might not be very long, the graphics might not be cutting edge, but it will definitely keep you entertained for a while.",1

75,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewYou know, when i was getting chased down a hallway by a demon made out of meat it hit me, i was actually scared! Not by cheap jumpscares or lame scare tactics, by actual legitimate buildup and payoff. Although it may not look it, Spooky's House is an amazing game that actually shows that true horror is still alive (even though there are still quite a few jumpscares in it XD). Plus it actually has a fun and intense boss battle that (no spoilers) has a pretty funny payoff. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of intense chases.",1
76,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Note: If you don't want my long winded review and wish to see the pro's/con's of this game just scroll paste my wall of text. However if you want my personal experience feel free to read.Now I have little time with this game keep that noted however i've had enough time with it to do a proper review of first impressions. This game starts off as a fun joke with a few cute jump scares, however that mood quickly turns grim. This game does not succeed with it's graphical appearance however the audio and ambience that you overhear quickly makes up for that. This game looks like it's just something some company threw together however if you go into how the monster is announced or how they introduce the new concepts via different room layouts, it quickly makes up for it's lack of looks with well polished audio as well as design. My first impressions of the game within the first 10 rooms was ""This is a joke of a game and dull already."" That was until the audio started tugging at the back of my mind and then I paused for the first time with the most creative surprise I had in a while, it was Spooky casually smiling at you through the static of the screen. The reason I mention this is that it was a well done concept that I can honestly say caught me off guard. So all these little things that stick to the back of your mind as you're going room by room pulled by curiosity leaves me to say that this game is definitely a great one. With it's design and use of just a few simple concepts it makes for a good experience. The last thing i'll mention that I liked that made it stand out from other ""horror"" games is that it right out introduces you the ""player"" as you dive into this house of horror. This makes for the fact that you directly are introduced, meaning there isn't some dull protagonist that you're hiding behind.Pros: 1:Audio/SFX is well polished and well used.2:Design is different than what i've encountered in the past as well as well thought.3:It slowly takes you deeper into the horror and leads to a climactic build up that was well done from my experience.4:Gives a nostalgic vibe with the room designs as well as environment.5:The game is Free to Play and a well done F2P game at that.Cons:1:Movement was quite odd and clunky at a few segments.2:Does not take kindly to players with a lower DPI 3:Textures were bland and reused makes for a dull expirience till the climax. However this minorly impacts the game.4:Lack of pull factors other than Spooky, and Curiosity and arguably the ambience.Mixed Factors:1:Voice acting was a double edged sword, on one hand it was cute and well presented on the other it wasn't executed properly. I personally enjoyed it, but other's could be turned away from the game with such a presentation.Overall Ratings:SFX/Audio 9/10Design 8/10Voice Acting 7/10Gameplay 6/10Character Introduction 8/10Graphic/Texture Rating 4/10Overal Rating 7.5/10(Keep in mind this is a F2P game)I know this rating doesn't make it seem like a must play game. However for it being Free and so well designed it is worth a try at the very least. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends in a heartbeat. Keep in mind though that this game immerses you via it's audio cues as well as it's climactic build up. If these factors do not interest you or if you're looking for a fast paced action game this is most likely not going to be something you will enjoy.",1
77,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Pros-Anxiaty Inducing Gameplay (which is what a horror game should have)- interesting visual style- good comical moments-lots of jump scaresCons-walking simulatorI really with there was more to this game than moving from room to room running from misc badies. perhaps puzzles or obsticals that increase difficulty when the slower monsters are fallowing you. however for what it is, Spooky's house of jump scares is great. interesting enough to keep you captivated for long periods of time.",1

85,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"10/10 game. The way the game draws itself out to be an easy game with specimen 1 (cardboard cutouts) is something I personally appreciate. I personally am not a very brave person and was scared by everything and was even scared by specimen 1 since I was expecting something to attack me. The game uses atmosphere to its advantage in an excellent way and after playing the game alone, I have seen stuff move such as my own shadow and flinch (true story). Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a great game to play with friends too as my friends would freak out when something happened on the laggy screen I cast onto which would make me smile as I was already in the next room. The only issue I have with the game is the screen moving downwards and to the left occasionally but it was easy to get past. I wish I could take screenshots to share with friends but print screen works just as well as a substitute. Definitely give the game a chance if you have the time since it's free.

There's randomly generated rooms that you must advance through, most of the time duplicates of previous rooms will turn up time after time.

101,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"It's not a bad game, it's just waaaay too slow for me. You practically do NOTHING for the first 500 rooms and then the ""scary"" moments aren't scary enough to be worth the boredom of the first 500 rooms :/",0
102,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Well, after room 300 I guess I've had enough of this game. The life-size wooden puppet thing does not adhere to its own rules of conduct and as a result is insanely difficult to get away from and the one time that I did escape it anyhow, I was arbitrarily killed by a long, narrow hallway because I took a random door instead of some other random door with no clue as to tell me that I took the wrong door. According to the game's wiki this game has several bugs which end up killing your character (which wouldn't be so bad if I could save my game whenever I wanted but unfortunately I can only save my game every 50 rooms at particular locations). The end result is that this ends up being a frustrating little game (despite it's good humor) even though it is free to play.With so many other games out there I think it's time for me to focus on something else.",0

109,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI'll throw the Fact the I haven't played many Games of this Genre in there right off the bat.According to that this Review might differs from the Point of View hold by a Person that has great Interest in the Indie-Horror Genre.Duo to the Fact that this is a Early Access Review I can't get much into Detail because we don't know yet what Changes this Title will see until its Release. Let's jump right to it then, shall we?In my Opinion is this Game quite enjoyable, at least if you don't try to not find it scary. Some Game Mechanics are pretty neat, as for example, the Fact that One can open Doors while walking backwards is something I'd like to see in more Games. I also appreciate CAT-DOS as Source of Background Information a great Deal.  But those are just small Details. I think what defines a Horror Game is the Atmosphere, and that is a very strong Point of this Title. Especially the Music is most of the Time on spot.The Enemy variety is okay for the Amount of Playtime and the the Graphics are pretty cute-ish when it comes to the Surroundings.I also might add that this Game has an pretty interesting Sense of Humor, which is normally not to be expected from a Horror Title. Which I personally can dig a great deal.As for my Part, I'll probably recommend 'Spooky's House of Jump Scares' to everybody who might have a Interest in Video Games of its kind.",1
110,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,Early Access Reviewwhen i saw this on the upcoming games i didn't know what to expect. But this must be the best jumpscare game i ever played. Really this must be the only game where you can get scared with cute cardbox cut outs and there are so many references to other horror games it's really nice to see all of them. Right now i am in room 400 after almost died because a cute jelly cardbox popped out the wall while i was being chased and let go of my mouse because of the shock.this is way better than any game where you just sit there waiting to get scared.  10/10,1

It only feels like i went through about 20 rooms because most of the time you will be walking throught the same repeated rooms over and over again to the point where you give up because its so boring. the game looks like a world i could build in Minecraft. Every time you make it through 50 rooms you're greeted with a elavator which takes you down to the next floor below, where the whole ♥♥♥♥ing process starts all over again. its really boring. oh did i forget to mention the lame jumpscares that sound like my 2 year old sister being tickled?  Oh yeah, once every 100 floors has an enemy in which you just gotta run away from. That's most probably the only fun thing about this game. You see an enemy, run fast through about 8 rooms (which will repeat) untill the enemy randomly disapears. then you're back to walking though the same boring rooms again. Sounds Fantastic doesn't it?

And my first encounter with the ghost? I exited the game. Yep. I was breathing heavily, and I felt light-headed. Really, this is my first ACTUAL experience on actually trying to play a horror game. And I really was actually going to faint. I'm guessing this is a player's first experience with playing their first actual horror? I dunno. But that ghost really did scared me. NOT SPOOKY. But the one who actually CHASES you. I was frightened. This game is awesome.

Once you realize that, the game completely loses its horror.Thus, while in the beginning I was nervous, that faded away and the game became simply boring and tedious.While I can see how many people sincerely enjoy this game, unfortunately I have to say that I feel more like it wasted my time, with me waiting for something cool to happen.",0
141,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewA fun and cute adventure that still manages to be creepy. The jumpscares are the kind that make you laugh for jumping at them, but the chases and certain environments are actually quite scary.Spooky is my waifu. 10/10",1
142,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,so a friend of mine already finished the game and i iam just to scared to play it but i still played a bit but anyways you when playing the game will face and endless repetitive room cycle whith no return.gameplay:actually not bad symple controls good spoopy atmosphere and it kinda as a SCP containment breach vibe to it.story (some spoilers): i havent got most of it but for what i got is that spooky (the ghost in the beginning) is trying to make an army of monsters aka specimens wich she created and ghosts which are the ppl that she killed with the monsters just so she can take over the world and make ppl stop calling her cute.overall: preety good game give it a try if you aren to spooked by eye bussines (i know i am) and try to get to the end (there are 2 btw). tip: if you want to understand the story read EVERYTHING.,1
143,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"1000 rooms, only 10 or so that are unique. Finale is not only clunky, but makes no sense and leaves a lot to be desired.I've never seen a game with so much filler.This game has such a long buildup, it makes it seem like there's something at least interesting at the end.The best way I can describe this game is unsatisfying. The virtual epitome of blue balls. I don't recommend this game to anyone, besides maybe the creepypasta backstories on the monsters that were either likely ripped from other websites or never fleshed out more than that text in-game at all.",0

148,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewTL;DR - Enjoy horror? Try it out.Expecting a silly little game trying to startle you with loud noises? Well, you'll get them, but you'll also get a lot more.Put simply, this game is a love letter to horror. At times it might be repetitive, but despite its cute graphical style, it also might genuinely freak you out too. The game really picks up after 50 or so rooms, so try to make it to around 100 before making a judgement.It's free, so it's definitely worth a go, despite what you might think.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KaXZw9q_sw ",1

156,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,Great game its not to scary i feel its good for people who are not much into the constant jumpscares but defenetly always has you lookng around. the reason why i rated this so early was because i got to room 59 and the alien ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ came at me and i was like nope nope nope nope nope,1

158,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"This game is great. I give it a 7 out of 10.This game is new and fresh because it's different than most horror game. It enbraces stereotypes of horror games in a cute and funny way to trick you. But before you know it the real horror begins with enticing chases and heart racing music that will put you in your seat. Don't be scared of the 1000 room bulletin. Every room is short and quick and your sprint refreshes everytime you enter a new room.  spoiler alert:[/you die in both endings]There is a good ending and a bad ending. And the good ending is worse but I feel like the end would be better if [/you didn't die] but at the same time that would kind of be a cop out. This game gets my nomination for the ""I thought this game was cool before it won an award""",1

160,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"Okay, where do i start with this game? Well it has and adorable ghost who is not only funny, is cool. there are jump scares, which make you want to hit yourself, ie cardboard cutouts- which is greatthe number of specimens or enemies makes adrenaline high, and makes for non repetitive interesting gameplay. all with non immersion breaking music. the narrative is amazing - more info at the end of the game! i highly recommend you challenge this game, its hard at fiirst but you get in the swing of it quickly - 5 stars",1
161,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThe game is REALLY well made. I love it! I just bought the game yesterday, but I've known about the game for months as i've seen Markiplier play it. Right now I'm at 100 room and that first monster that chaced me was scary! The whole time I was being chaced by it my mouth was gaping open the whole time xD Good work on the game! I can't wait to see more updates!",1
162,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI never thought i would be scared of this game,a little boy hiding being a screen watching markipler play this i never thought it would be scary.When the first jumpscare happened it didnt scare me but when i went on it started too.When i got to that dead space looking part and i turned on the power again,i paniced and died...also spooky got to stop her crap! ""here have infinite stamina"" me:""awww thanks"" *tries to run* really? but im stuck at room 700 before you make the rest,cant wait! :D",1
163,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"This game really is a good one. Albeit it being cute, it still has the spookiest parts at all times. Sometimes, I refuse to keep going, because I freeze with fear every 56 rooms or so. So far, I'm still scared of the Merchant (basically specimen 6) every single time, because, that face is just screaming agony. So, yah. I would nominate this as the scariest game in my book. And, believe me, I don't get scared easily.",1

This Free game will make you jump from silly creatures to heart racing disturbing monsters that show up randomly. I would give this one a go if you want to raise your heartbeat a few levels fast.

165,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,At first ı thought this was just a small jump scare game that makes you feel like there is a catch in it and not cute at all. I played it and kept going ı saw the slime thing and the bug thing didnt scare me at all. but once ı entered the school room ı realised what a mistake ı have done. First it was the japanese girl after that there were the puppets and some other things ı was too afraid to look while running away even the cute jump scares were scary as ♥♥♥♥ but nothing was scary enough compared to him... The doll make with his syringe and♥♥♥♥♥♥tick tack noises coming after u if you dont look at him ı screamed like hell. After that ı realised this is a good game for group activity so ı offered to many groups that ım part of 10/10 greaty scary game and halloween activity,1

167,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"This game puts great humor in horror. It gets dark in some areas and has the tendency to scare you with things you will be ashamed to admit have scared you. The progression of the rooms feels repetitive, but this is perfect to get the player off guard to hit them with, you guessed it, a jumpscare. Whether the scare be a puppet, a deer, a spider, or even a cup of tea, everything in this game does a good job at scaring someone their first playthrough or so. The style of it makes it one of the cutest and creepiest scary games you can play.",1

169,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"This game makes no sense. The visuals are adorable and cute, but I can't help but jump out of my skin whenever a cardboard cut out pops out of a wall with a hideous sound effect. This game has atmosphere in bucket loads. I couldn;t help but keep sprinting, even when the scary music and the monsters that chase you stop. If you're a fan of tense horror games, I'd say this one's definitely worth a go.

171,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewHoly Hell! Give this thing your full attention if you are at all interested in the horror genre. Despite the name, the game is only sparsely reliant on simple jump scares and instead paints a truly horrific atmosphere of dread, tension and tongue-and-cheek satire. It's a really good sign when you're on pins and needles at the mere prospect of opening a door. I found this one thoroughly difficult to put down for long. Seriously, This programmer deserves a friggin' medal!--Plus, the low res graphics make the visuals doubly creepy. Bonus!",1
172,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Tried, got turned into a puppet on room 357, because the creepy baddies float through the walls.Still cant fingure out why I dont want to look into the fan.Incredibly well done, Definitely provoked some mental problems I will have to deal with later.9/10 would be creeped out again ",1
173,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Product received for freei love this game. I like the specimens, ALL the specimens, and i thought this game was scary and cute. They did a really good job of the monster design and the total creep factor. This game is so cool, i wish it was real. I thought that the dlc was good too. The game had cute and scary moments that were really good.Akuma Kira, Psycobilly, everyone elseYou are geniuses. ",1

180,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"After seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,I wanted to make a review talking about what a GREAT horror game this is.First of all,it's free.I really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out.Karamari Hospital (The DLC) costs just under $6,but if you enjoyed the game I would recommend the dlc.Now,I'm gonna get into the main review.The game itself does have a lot of references,but that's what makes it great.The game doesn't feel like it ""stole"" these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references.1.If you find jump scares scary.GET THIS GAME.2.If you are unsure,try watching Markiplier or someone play it,that's how I found out about it.Just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises.3.I found I rarely died from enemies,but that was because I was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn't get near them.TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE ENEMIES!!(I won't say them all,just some stuff to know)(Possible Spoilers)Specimen 1.The main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren't scary,but later into the game,I began to fear them more then the actual enemies.They jump scare you,but the do it ALL the time,and it's terrifying.Specimen 2 and 3 chase you around,they aren't the scariest.I skipped a bit of the game,(I'm gonna replay it all soon),so I missed the specimen 4 and 5 parts.They still look spooky though.Specimen 6 is well...The bane of my existence.Specimen 6 is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.His death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of Zelda references,which I quite enjoyed.Just,when you play the game,BE READY FOR SPECIMEN 6.Specimen 7 isn't really scary.But it confuses you,and makes chase's with other monsters MUCH HARDER.Specimen 8 is the deer god.Things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then 8 shows up,and the terror begins.Although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.Specimen 9 randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.I have never encountered him before,[spoileri] He re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.It is fun,and similar to the Ganon battle from LOZ:OOC.[/spoileri] Specimen 10 is featured in a cool 'futuristic' area.I don't entirely remember him,but I remember he is VERY hard to run away from.Specimen 11,who I refer to as the 'beef god',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.I remember him from let's plays of the game,so maybe I was just nervous when I entered his area.The area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.There is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.Specimen 12 the 'old man' or 'the mansion' is one massive room.It takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the 'old man'.It was very fun,and scary.Specimen 13 who I call 'the siren' is a monster very similar to Kaernk from 'Amnesia:The Dark Descent'.You must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.It was really fun,and the area before was very scary.That raps up the review of the monsters,but I have a few more things to say.1.The game doesn't have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror.2.The game has A LOT OF REFERENCES,which is one of the best parts of the game.3.THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :3)I would definitely recommend this game.10/10  ",1

182,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017,"The only scary thing about this game is that the developers thought that slowly walking around opening doors with interjections of comically-horrendous jump scares every 10 minutes would somehow be playable. It's not.I originally played this game at a friend's, which meant I had to install the game on my own machine and play for 5 minutes in order to be eligible to write a review. I imagine the feeling is similar to that of visiting an uncle that abused you as a child. My non-masochistic nature screamed at me to stop, but I felt I had an obligation to bridge some of the unprecedented gap between the game's reviews and its quality.",0
183,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"The game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring. Every 100 rooms (=1floor), there are generally 2 or 3 stuff happening, a big room (which is actually multiple rooms) with spooky stuff, a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor, and some notes left by some dude for you to read. Otherwise you're just walking through the same rooms over and over. Sometimes you think a room is important but it's actually just a regular room with nothing special. Oh and jump scares.But when you're not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas.Hopefully it's free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that you're wondering if you're not paying the game with your time.",0

186,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"I really wish I could recomend this. It's free and omages classic horror in clever ways, but it commits the cardinal sin of horror; it's boring!

188,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Its a very slow burn of a game, but I'm not sure if there's actual payoff. After 300 rooms it just felt like this was a hallway simulator with a rare jump scare. You would think with a name like House of Jump Scares that it would have too many, but no, it doesn't really have too much of anything except hallways. Kudos on the horror pop culture references, but I'm not sure who this game is for. Its too cute to be spooky and too dark to be cute.",0
189,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI have completed the game and got the bad ending.I've also gotten the other ending.This game starts out really terrifying, with the music and graphics. But it only gets worse, Monsters will start chasing you and sounds will creep you out. At points you are tested on various tasks of survival. There are many wonderful things I could talk about Spooky's. Specimen 4 is one of my favorite enemies in the entire game, the red bloody claws and calm behavior make her awesome.Spoiler warning:The late game really tests your patience and observance, stalkers, water monsters, long halls and very awkward corridors make the monsters who get faster later on more challenging. You will make mistakes ultimately leading to your death if you're not careful. Seriously! This game can get fairly challenging at points. I like it when games add challenge which the game lacked when it wasn't finished. The game is still fair once you know what you're doing. I also enjoyed the bad ending.Overall I find players may appreciate this game for what it is.",1

192,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Short review for a cute but short ""Spooky"" horror game. Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a indie 1st person walking simulator, you take on the role of an historian on an expedition to explore a strange castle. After this you're given little to no explanation other than the odd notes found through the game. The game basically boils down to open door, proceed through room open next door. It gets old really, really fast. To keep things interesting, the game throws some new enemy types (which I honestly couldn't tell apart from the others) and they spice things up with the rooms. The biggest problem with this game is repetition, I think somewhere around 70-80% of rooms are always empty and are basically the same. It's really boring to be honest, and even the ocasional jump-scare won't impress you after you realise you spent 3-4 hours pressing E to proceed in a ""horror"" game. It had some interesting ideas to it, but it's just too boring to play. I guess if they made the rooms more random it would have been ok, but eh. It still feels boring and bland to play, it's ok for the first 15-20 minutes but don't expect much to change.The good:Good audioDecent atmosphereThe Bad:Lackluster gameplayRepetitive roomsLack of variety overallBoringA 4/10 at best",0
193,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis is a game that I would have spend $10 dollars to buy. First of all, it's a completely new concept for a horror game that completely blew my mind. Also, the variety of monsters in this game is superb, and all of them equally terrifying. I must say though, the puppet was the most terrifying since it reminded me of the weeping angels from Dr. Who (yes, I am a nerd, I know that.) Conclusion? Download the game! It's amazing, it's free, and an excellent horror experience!

195,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewIt's a great game with plenty of things to scare you. The scariest for me are the violent deer and that Deer God thing. The game would be better if it had full controller support. Other than that, it's perfect! It's startling, scary, and spine tingling. Not for the average gamer. Oh, and if you though Five Nights at Freddy's was bad, try this. Have fun!",1
196,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Just finished the game and while it does have quite an atmosphere to go on as well as the music, the game do become rather repetetive with the rooms. From what I understand the rooms that are not scripted are randomized and yield different results.The specimens were unique in their own ways, but they weren't too much of an issue once you understand how each work and can deal with them with rather ease.The stories that you learn throughout the game have no lasting appeal in the game, they happen and once you get past one it's over and is forgotten suddenly.Playing through the game by making it past 1000 rooms is not worth it, you're not rewarded with the endeavours you go through, it's basically just a non-standard game over anyway where you accomplish nothing, i.e., just a bad ending.On another note, it is indeed for free so you could give the game a go and see for yourself whether you'd like the game or not. This game, however, just isn't my cup of tea.",0
197,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewA great game. You don't expect too much out of a Free 2 play Indie game that's 250 MB big, but this game is incredibly fun and scary. As a so called ""horror enthusiast"" I honestly have very few games I enjoyed playing more.",1

It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time. I walk into a room. See weird goo on ground. Realize this is when it gets ♥♥♥♥ing terrifying. Read emo love poem on table. Turn around. Scream irl.

For the lovely price of FREE I'd have to recommend it to anyone who wants to be spooked a little. Maybe not too scary to the more hardcore types who laugh in the face of all danger, but for most people I'd think it's pretty good. Some dangers are easily beaten, however, and the terror starts to wane once you realize how to escape them easily.

210,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"This is a great game in my opinion. I loved it just going through 1000 rooms from being cute to freakin terrifing it really is a great game, but thier is one thing about the game that I really hate and i hope you will change it in the future I mean it is still in early access and im sure thiers still things that you need to fix but what I dont like is the ending becuase throughout the game besides trying to survive Im always thinking of what heppen to this place or what was this place and who was Spooky really also what were they exactly doing here it was the mystery that also really kept me going through the game and I just couldent wait to see what happens at the end and dreams crushed Spooky was creating an army and all the shadow people were people before me to go in the mansion but I was confused becuase I still dont know what exactly this place was or what they were doing or how Spooky became well Spooky and you didnt even explained why she was creating an army what was the purpose of all of this is thier going to be a second game that explains all of ths (a prequal) or is that really it cause I really got into the game but then boom worst ending ever all of that all of what i was trying to figure out was for nothing. no offence but ending was worst then Outlast (person your playing dies after all that youve done in the game).",1

213,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis is a very unique and great game. The reason I love it is it scares me so badly and yet I am determined to finish it. What this game does, is it sets you in a false sense of security, makes you feel like one room is safe and okay, and then when you go to the next room it rips you to pieces with its terrifying jumpscares. From the monsters (I HATE YOU WEEPING ANGEL PUPPET MASTER YOU SCARE ME TO BITS BUT ITS AWESOME) to the cute little jumpscares, this game has it all. If you enjoy horror and things that can really set you in the right mood to want to scream, then check this game out. I don't recommend it to people who are susceptible to heart attacks, because this game could cause one if you don't take a break every now and then, but other than that this game is awesome, and I love it. Can't wait for it to be finished fully! <3",1

215,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"The best way for me to describe this game is as a much need satire of the horror genre. Experienced as if you're playing the history of the genre from the worst of the newest, to the best of the classics.Starts out with the very worst of the genre the modern cheap jumpscare tactics, and slowly brings in tropes from classic games making it better and better the more rooms you go through.The DLC while not neccesary, itself is a homage to PT/silent hills, even going so far as to have ""RIP Konami"" in the credits.Everything good and wrong with this genre in one game. 10 out of 10",1

THIS WAS THAT GAME. Now I saw it in the store and thought ""Hmmm wtf is this kids game"" But my curiosity of course led me to clicking on it. I was surprised by it's fantastic reviews. So I of course decided to give it a look. Upon entering this game you're thrown into door simulator 2015. At around room 30 I was hit with my first jump scare. A small cardboard cut out of a tree. Now, this doesnt seem like much until you understand I literally had to take a 30 second break, I was so panicked. Granted I'm not very good at dealing with horror but still. After finally completing the game, being chased by the most horrifying monsters with the most horrifying effects through changing terrain and a variety of different twists, I found myself nearly screaming with every new twist.

As for the actual content in the rooms that weren't empty, the reviews oversold the game for me; I was really expecting something more as I progressed, but that expectation never materialized.I think this game could be something really good, but as of right now, it could absolutely stand to be pared down to 500 rooms of cute terror.

238,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game made me want to run away from my computer and never turn it back on again. It's surprising how scary a game, that looks like it was made in 1995, can be. You end up sprinting through every room knowing that if you stay still for just a moment you're likely to get ripped to peices and some horrible annimation will come up on the screen that would be enough to give your children future mental issues and kill off your grandma. So you run and you run, even from the sounds coming from everywhere, and you run straight into a guy that wants to put a pin through your eyeball and turn you into one of his puppets. My advice would be: Assume everybody and everything wants to kill you, don't explore, just run as fast as you can... Into a cardboard cut-out of a pumpkin that will jump out at you, and that in any other situation wouldn't be all that bad, but here it makes you fall backwards off your chair. Oh and don't look behind you; all you will see is a guy with a machete trying to hack you up, or a ghost girl that want to eat your brain, or some green guy that for some reason seems really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with you as if you haven't got enough on your plate already.

I think it peaked out at 750 rooms, but I continued till about 1021 before deciding to quit. Don't judge this game by its silly appearance...

The graphics are definitely akin to those you probably saw in your childhood days when playing Doom, but the floating ghost, Spooky, and the randomly cute jump-scare plywood cut outs are really what make this game. It's positively adorable, with a perfect amount of terror thrown in, and has me ITCHING for the day that my PC is replaced so that I can play it. I can't wait to see how this game developes.- Graecyn K | PCGamerGirl.COM ",1
257,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access Review*note* Pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indieDB and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games (and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version 1.2). Now for the review.I'm not really a person who could judge what is considered ""cute"". i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing. that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn't need to follow the path to catch you. So in that regard i guess you could call them scary too. i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room (like how they were in the indieDB version i played). But outside of those ""enemies"", the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing. on top of that if it's your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there's no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances. What i mean is that unlike other horror games (good ones that is) there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the ""rules"" to win against said enemies are laid out. take for example the first resident evil, the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing what's in the room with you. following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie A) you'll notice you use up almost all your ammo and B) that you'll take damage whereas avoiding it you'll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies (well agile while using tank controls) so evasion is a preferred option when you can.That's not to say that how the enemies appear in SPHJ is bad in fact the opposite. the fact you don't know when you'll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds it's own eeriness as you don't know what the next room holds for you. You have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker.However this brings up an issue i have with the game, there's way too much luck involved. i'll give a good example, the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out, just run. but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first ""catwalk"" room (that's what i call it at least, the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions). If you just dead sprint you have a 50/50 chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in 3 hits.There are other points like this as there's an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough i've yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong (or right in my case as, again, i haven't encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs). so like i said, this game takes alot of luck if you're going to get far (or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run).the other issue i have i'm not sure if it's an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if it's just how the game happened to be made. the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room. what i mean is that you can't just hold down the W key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room. No, in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move. this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you won't move (and take damage) till you remember to release the forward key and press it again. Like i said i'm not sure if it's intentional or not, if it's not then i hope the devs will work on this as it's basically a cheap beginner's trap. But other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and can't wait to see what the full release is like.",1
258,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI want to preface my review by stating that I find this game to be fun even with the minimalist aspects of walking from one room or passage to another. The intrigue of what will be in the next room entertains me and leaves me with a sense of wonder. I keep feeling a voice in my head say, ""Just one more room..."" and so on as my character explores the mansion.I love the art design, and the cell-shaded look to it along with the cute ""cutouts"" that pop up in tight spaces here and there look very well done. I will have to say this though, there was a constant popping in the audio feed which made it a bit annoying to continue further in the game and it also took me at least ten tries before I could get past the warning screen and move ahead in the game without it crashing on me. I actually thought I was doing well, making it to the 75th room when I stopped to play a mockup of House of the Dead, and the game crashed on me yet again.I hope that they fix that bug as well as the audio bug that is still haunting this game because I think it has a lot of potential; I for one have to say how terrified I was of what happened in room 60 and beyond.For now, this game gets a 6/10. Pros:~ Great Art Design that looks great and brings me back to 1995 and Doom related games.~ While there are a lot of rooms that seem the same, there are subtle nuances that make them a bit different each time.~ The Jump scare moments, especially with the cute cut-outs actually got me. Kudos.~ Easy to get hooked.Cons:~ Audio bug that sounded like a bowl of Rice Krispies in my ears.~ Game is prone to crashing on the warning screen especially but anytime after that as well.~ No options section in the main menu except to teleport to different sections of the game (Room 50, 100, 150, etc.)",1

Game would be exponentially better with some Spooky development-♥♥♥♥ that puppet-The better monsters were sorely underused. The Mummy was great, but the Deerhead guy could have seen some more spotlight-Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that puppet. Sooooo ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. ",1
264,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game i only played it for 1 hour reached room 300 died once this game just gave me few heart attacks the most scary creepy thing in this game is the sounds you dont know when a cute lil thing come out of the wall just to scare you will keep cursing all the way to the end , there is some monsters and some rooms will just let u quit (for weak hearts dont play this game if you cant handle the jumpscares) Nice Graphic ha ha but really Nice Game .I do recommend this game to who ever love to take challenges , have patience , strong heart , open mind  and love the Loud creepy sounds :)",1
265,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewSo I'm playing this game thinking ""Oh I've been pretty well at horror games in the past. This shouldn't be too hard."" WRONG. HOLY CRAP IS THIS GAME WELL MADE. Okay, so it rips off some other horror games, but it uses them all pretty well. When you get to a new checkpoint, and move to a new area, the door animation looks directly ripped from the first Resident Evil. That alone sent chills down my spine. And the fact that no two games are the same makes for an interesting playthrough. What might have been the way to get out of a room once might change completly the next time you find that room. Oh, and you will also find the same rooms all the time. The only differences are that some monster/ghost is in the next room. With the hidden layers of story like FNAF, the gameplay of Amnesia (wandering around aimlessly), and the erieness of Slender, this game is fantastic.",1

268,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis is basically FNAF's formula of taking something simple and throwing enough mystery at it to keep you interested. It's way less original than FNAF somehow though..You get ""randomly"" generated rooms in a maze like house that is full of jump-scares, monsters and references. It's a very simplistic idea but it's also done very well. Even the jump-scares are done right, showing that timing and sound is what matters.There is a story and it's rather cute. Cute enough to be out of place, and that's why it's good. Everything feels out of place just to screw with you. It's not a pretty game with high quality gore and HD blood. It's a simple game that throws you into the unknown and cute world of ""something is off but I can't put my finger on it"".The only issue that I had with it is the framerate. While it stays at 60 constantly, it somehow feels like it drops regularly. Maybe this was intentional but I don't know...",1

272,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewOverall, the game has a lot of unused potential. Its fun for a while, going through the randomly generated rooms. However, there is just too much laid back time. I find myself running through the rooms, just trying to make it to the next save point.  It would be nice if the monsters within the house appeared even just a little bit more often, or if the room designs varied much more. It was bland seeing the same rooms over and over again.The chases are nice. The music goes along well with the chases, as well, creating a good environment for when your running away from death. The designs of the things you see inside are very interesting and creepy indeed.All it really needs is more variety and less time spent walking through a load of empty rooms. I do, however, recommend a playthrough of it. It is free, after all.",1

274,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI love this game and I can not wait for the full version to be released (whenever that is) its the type of game that does everything right when you are playing using our knowlage as gamer's against us to try and mess with our heads at some of the later points of the games and actually informs you on some of the creatures only through little notes that are scattered through-out the randomly generated map, if you havent tried this game yet I highly recomend it",1
275,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis is one of the scariest, eeriest, most bone-chilling freeware games out there. Don't let the pricetag fool you, you get more than a bang for your buck. In my opinion this gamne is up there with SCP Containment Breach and Cry of fear",1
276,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThe things I dislike about Early Access title, is that indie developers never fulfilled their promises.  I know there's a lot of them that are still not complete to this day.  So hopefully this interesting horror game can final nail it.  Spooky's House of Jump Scares is very similar to one series that is part of the Creepypasta Universe: SCP Foundation.  Also know as Secure Contain Protect.  This game has the similar premises of the SCP Foundation, and its a decent one at best.  These specimen you encounter adds nice tension throughout each same rooms that you enter over and over again, even the game mentions about it, if you read the notes that is to get you more invested to the game lore.  The game sadly doesn't learn a thing or two from Bloodborne and Alien Isolation, which those game refines the horror genre completely.  Yes I am aware this came out at January before Bloodborne got released.  I would have expected the game break free from the cliches that horror games have been stuck with in the past.  I'm looking at you both Slender and Amnesia!The gameplay is all about running away from the Specimen and go to one room to the next.  You have a health bar and stamina system that it seems its trying to play like Dark Souls a bit in First-Person, the game has no boss battles at all, so the challenges is to run away and dig yourself into the game lore.  You take damage if your too close to the Specimens, however you can get instant killed by one of them if your not very careful in one room.  You do get an axe very late in the game but combat feels sloppy at times, maybe it'll be better integrated at full release?  Sadly the game is not complete right now.  There's still a few rooms to go in order to see more Specimen and finally know the truth behind this curses house and the company behind it.The optimization is bad, there's no way to change the resolution, or the game doesn't have settings to make the game perform better.  You can change the framerate but that about it.  Hopefully, the creator will make the game run a lot better than the state its currently in right now!  Visually its not a bad looking game, the Specimen looks nice, they have quite disturbing powers to mess with you, and the sound effects are average at best.  Not much to say about the score, its ok for now.  Maybe the final build will have a good credit theme when you reach the one room to get the answers we all want.  Who knows when this will be finished.  So I'm recommending this.  Because its free, and well despite its disappointing shortcomings the game has potential to be something worth playing from beginning to end.  Why not let your friends play it, or better let some young child play it and he or she will know what its like getting their guts spooked!  Hee hee hee...",1

At least until that... little girl. Ugh. The main horrors are based off of a myriad of different horror games. There is a slime monster, that I just equate to Slimer from Ghostbusters. There is a spider that is from Resident Evil. There is a little ghost girl whom I can only assume is from F.E.A.R. And then the return of death incarnate for me. Silent Hill references.

The game starts out very cute and innocent, the first ""enemies"" in the game are cardboard cutouts of skeletons and slimes that pop out from the wall.

Now all that goes through your mind is the combination ""Alt + F4"".That was my experience with Spooky's House of Jump Scares.I honestly don't think I'll ever finish this game.",1

297,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewI remember playing this a few months ago, after I found it on Desura while searching for a good scare. Came across it, looked cute and didn't think it would be that scary, I actually downloaded it to troll. So I play, lovin' the graphic style, then things start popping out and I start getting terrified to the point I'd rather just play Amnesia.Since then, this game has muc bigger rooms, more objects, a weapon, many more sounds for the scares, windows, etc. I actually played it a bit too much to where it didn't really scare me but after this it got me because of these new sounds. There are also dark rooms in which a flashlight is needed, and the HUD has been improved. This game can really turn into something amazing. What I disliked is the stupid intro.. It was meant to be funny, I'm sure, but it annoyed me, it's my opinion so..The downfalls; The options menu is terrible in my opinion, I sat in my chair pressing enter about 20 times trying to turn Invert Mouse on, but had to position it perfectly under the line, it's a horrible set up compared to how the rest of the game is. The game is also not complete, but this is a small issue as many people will probably quit and uninstall after a certain ""ghost"" starts following in room **. To those looking at the requirements, they are completely over the top. Windows XP is capable, 2 GB RAM is perfectly fine, and you don't need an i3, currently using an Intel Core Duo 2.0 GHz.8/10 - Who knew a cute game could scare someone?",1

Just Freaking Grab IT ALREADY!!Alright, fair enough this is my review after a first look at Spooky's House of Jumpscares. A really cool, interesting and original psychological horror game. With a cute and simplistic art style, the game does a really good job of immersing you into the atmosphere, with creeping looking corridors, scattered notes, and well timed music. The jumpscares are spaced enough to not be too common, but they do come up at just the right time to scare your♥♥♥♥♥♥off. The multiple kinds of enemies to doesn't allow you to get to comfortable, but the progression through them is very well made. And with a few minigames to add some subtle messages to it, this game is totally worth the grab... even more so since it's free. Totally recommend it... 10/10.If you're still not convinced, I played this game live on twitch, so if you're interested to see how it looks, here's the highlights: http://www.twitch.tv/caramida10/c/6602001I only managed to make it to room 300 before my heart gave out, but I'm really pumped to continue.

305,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThe game is great for easing players into first person horror games as well as it's references to other famous horror games such as SCP and Silent Hill, I fairly enjoyed the game and was a little disappointed that there wasn't an option to adjust video settings but that's alright.Only found like 2 bugs within the game, one being that your stamina drains each time you press space even if you're standing still, the other bug is each time you enter a new room the game can't read which key is being pressed so you just stand still unless you press the key again. also as a side note I don't know if it's a bug or not but when being chased by Heather she tends to get stuck by the door entrance when running from her in the walless maze rooms.",1

PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!",1
308,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewSo this game is a good horror game that relies mostly on the ""It's going to get you"" scares, and pop ups. You'll find notes scattered about that develop a story and pull you into the game to give you a reason to keep going. The rooms also do a good job at being interesting and giving enviormental clues. I wont say much else as experincing it first hand is really the only way to even understand what others might be saying. I wound up dying in a fashion that I didn't understand in room 312 due to an encounter, but I'll defintely pick it up again to see it through to the end. Worth the free price. 10/10 Would unwrap a dissapointing present again.",1

310,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewFun for a quick jump scare, Quite a long game for a completely free to play game. It starts off cutesy but soon gets darker (in lighting and tone).7/10Review:Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a fairly fun 'horror' game. It starts with a rather cute looking ghost 'spooky' telling you to traverse the rooms of the mansion, Along the way you'll see cute cardboard cutouts of octopi and ghosts. As you get further into the mansion you will meet other monsters that will chase in a less jump scary fashion such as a slime monster or a ghost girl.The only real downfalls this game has is that it is rather repetitive, as it is jump scares after a short while they lose their edge and scariness so you just end up speeding through each room and majority of the monsters are just slow chasers so you can just outrun them. It does have some different sections amidst the repetitive-ness such as a space-like section, a rusty school section, etc.It's mainly a shame that after room 760 there is nothing new (for now) as the developer has a message pop up stating that from then on it is incomplete.",1
311,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewThis game.... It's so charming and cute, atleast, for the first part of the game, it's a very satirical game, and it knows how to be satirical perfectly. And best of all it's absolutely FREEEEEE!!!!",1

That's why I decided to start off with Spooky's House of Jump Scares. It's a seemingly cute and cuddly parody of modern horror games, where you travel around a massive mansion full of terrifying monsters. For the first few minutes you wonder why you though of getting it. For the next few hours, you're running for your life from the freakiest things ever. Think cardboard cutouts aren't scary?

338,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Product received for freeIt delivers upon what the name implies, and often that is all you should expect from a free game.That said, there are flaws that left me not to recommend it.-you can't use your mouse in the menu-there is no volume slider-the resolution can only be set to wrong and worse, and has no manual imput-clicking ""new game"" automatically overrides your previous save without a confirmation-mouse drag because the game has an fps cap (I'm assuming that's the reason, anyway)-you cannot pause the game or otherwise access the menu during a cutscene-you cannot move backwards in the menu by pressing Esc-alt-tabbing leaves the game's audio on-alt-tabbing while not having the game paused or in a menu traps your cursor in the center of your screen, which can only be resolved by opening your task manager and forcefully closing the application (without your mouse) or restarting your pc.The last being my main concern, honestly.It's a very minor issue if you know what's going on, but it's intrusive. And I could imagine it to be quite difficult to deal with if you're not the kind of person who uses the task manager frequently, or simply doesn't know how to use shortcuts. (except for alt-tab(though it could still be triggered by programs like skype))All in all, it feels like a mobile port, and a poor one at that.The pixelized stylization is alright, and overall the game is decent enough, but I can't be bothered to put up with such an absolute bottom-of-the-barrel UI.",0

345,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016,"Overall: Not very Interesting, repetitive.There are some levels that just skull♥♥♥♥ you for no reason, offering no skillful way to counter it other than hitting escape and exiting the game. Lacking save points make the player more on edge, but in turn make gameplay experience suffer because if one level is failed, you have to repeat countless levels with no rewards. Although I do enjoy the cartoon jump scares somewhat, it seems as if they are just thrown in to make a boring game less boring, but end up being a mere annoyance once the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses start showing up. Randomly generated levels with minecraft's ""10 blocks"" render distance setting on fails to even create the illusion of skillful navigation within long levels. The lack of variance in level design makes interest fade in the middle stages of the game. Minor issues such as having to re-press ""W"" every time a level loads in order to keep moving forward adds a unending inconvenience that makes repeating levels that much more boring to navigate. OP Enemies with minimal deterrent methods (The ""Ben Drowned"" Creepypasta enemy which you just have to keep looking at for the remainder of the level, which proves boring when you get slapped with a bunch of linear ""Maze Pit Levels"") remove any psychological deterioration elements from the game, as they just become a minor annoyance, *with exception of the monster that turns the graphics into bone-shilling youtube666-era designs*.  Sound design is good, as music is intentionally screeching in order to install anxiety within the player, but some cartoon jump scare sounds drag on and unneededly ruins the ""Spooky"" aesthetic. Good for the first while, but I don't think a lot of people could enjoyfully complete the full 1000 Levels. Not from being scared, but from boredom. ",0

Not enough real horror to keep me hooked for the whole thing though.- Too boring and repetitive: Something big(ish) happens, like, every 50 rooms (give or take, depends).

Its just creepy going through all those rooms though. And 1000 rooms?! I'm no where near that! But I will say this game is really good.,1
362,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015,"Early Access ReviewIt isn't the most scary game out there, but it's effective and interesting. The game starts to convince you to feel that it is a joke, and isn't supposed to be actually scary. Then, something silly catches you off guard and startles you. You laugh it off, embarressed. Then, there come Spooky's ""specimens,"" which are startling and not cute, which the you might not expect. The game adds more depth with a few references and rooms with silly morbid mini-games, which emphasizes how much you should actually fear ""Spooky."" Spooky is a very adorable character, too. I love her design and how she too seems like a joke at first, but then you start to realize she's pretty evil and crazy. (I have a playtime of only about 10 minutes because I'm having trouble getting the newest build to display properly, I've played this a while ago before it's steam release.)",1
2474,Path of Exile,2017,"What makes this game so good:-It's free boi-Money can't give you an advantage (aside from more stash tabs...).-Immense depth, pleasant mechanics.-Satisfying gameplay.-Enorm lasting appeal and replayability-Fun expansions, there's always something new to do.-Diversity of gameplay.-Amazing developers.-Everything always seems well-thought and polished, few bugs and imbalances.-Massive skill tree",1
2475,Path of Exile,2013,its awesome..it is even better than diablo 3...and its even for free !!! and defenetily the first freegame i really like..cant believe theyr making a game like this for free..but u can buy ingame items and stuff with real money if you want to,1
2476,Path of Exile,2018,"So currently I only have around 24 hours and I am in the third out of four acts, this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind.Path of Exile is fantastic. EVERY steam owner should at one point or another try this game. However, it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around 7 hours to get there (for me at least). This game is basically the paladins to diablo. Personally I think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points.Art StyleIn act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage. I personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired, nasty, depressing backgrounds. Thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act 3 being the nicest looking act thusfar. Diablo I think should be a keymark for this. Just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile. Diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play. PoE is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at. ProgressionOk this is PURELY opinion based but I will try to be as objective as possible. Diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there. In this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds. In PoE it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online. That being skills are merely ""items"" that you equip. This system allows for MUCH more creativity BUT can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players. In MY personal opinion I think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion. HOWEVERPoE wins in the costumazation department PURELY because of the passive skill tree. Holy crap. This skill tree. No barriers locked behind class walls. All classes can have any passive. That is SO. REFRESHING. Rarely ever do I see games do this and I still have no Idea why. GameplayThis is an Action RPG. Meaning prepare  yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat. Not really much to say other then that its very fast paced. Overall This is a must play. I intend to progress farther and play for engame content.",1
2477,Path of Exile,2018,"Path of Exile is an online economy simulator set in the web-based fantasy world of poe.trade. It is designed around an unregulated online item economy, character customisation littered with noob traps with only a few endgame-viable builds, trade-based PvP and races to be 'First!' and annoy everyone else just trying to play the damn game in peace and quiet.",0
2478,Path of Exile,2018,So as a ARPG this game is pretty good way better then Diablo 3. The game plays more like Diablo 2 mixed with a bit of the original Diablo. My issue with the game is the unintresting story line this game has. I love ARPG games but I really need a good story to go along with it. This game is good for mindless killing of tons of trash mods an grinding for better gear which some people really like doing and really I don't mind doing either but on my way to that point I would like a story that I can get into an really feel connected with the character I am playing.For me I just can't connect with the character I am playing. Your character barely even speaks. If you are looking for a good ARPG with story at least in my opinion I would look for something else. For me I wouldn't recommend this game.,0

2482,Path of Exile,2018,"I want to love Path of Exile. I really do. The developers are amazing and they've created an action RPG that far surpasses the scope of Diablo 3. They keep pumping regular updates and the new season ladders keep content fresh. The story is...there...if you want to get into it, but you aren't going to play this game for the story. The gameplay is absolutely amazing. IF you have a good build.And that's where the game falls short for me. Building your character is brutal and unforgiving in Path of Exile. A couple of mistakes ensure that your build becomes low tier garbage and you have to either spend hours grinding for Regret orbs which let you reskill ONE point each, or you have to build a new character from scratch. Some people enjoy this kind of rigidity. I do not. I can't honestly enjoy playing the game when half my time is spent alt tabbed into the build maker and character build guides online, just so I don't mess my character and turn it into an unplayable dung heap.",0
2483,Path of Exile,2018,"The game Diablo 3 should have been... When you look at Path of Exiles, with its small team of developers, and at least when they started the limited amount of cash, they must have had and then you look at Blizzard with their war chest and you compare Diablo 3 and PoE and you can clearly see how much better game this one is.The only microtransactions are for cosmetics... you sometimes wonder how this people even eat...

Desync is responsable for many hardcore deaths every day     ->* server side problems combined with desync, last time this happened 4/6 players died from a hardcore party, one of them was level 90 ->2) Performance :    ->*depending on your playstyle:      ->**if you play alone : in town, eternal laboratory or any other empty place i manage to get 170+ fps when you start playing the game it will go to 60-70, if you are doing a end game map with some special mods it will drop to 30-50       ->** if you play in a party: the performance will be lower because there is more stuff going on but some times it will go to ""1"" when certain skills are used   ->* Death animation will make you drops fps if you kill large packs of monsters   ->* range attacks and spells : discharge, lightning arrow, fireball, freezing pulse, ice spear, poison arrow... will lower your framerate but only in end-game or when used in a combination with cast on crit   ->* the game will just not work properly if you have a "" creative sound card""    ->* cpu bound : changing your graphics options will  not make a big difference in fps gain or loss during fights, even if you have 1 fps the game will not use more than 30-40% of your graphics card (depending on how powerfull it is)  ->3) Bugs: yes we know that every game has bugs but     ->* in a end game focus on map drops you should work on fixing them first :      ->** monsters stuck behind walls and cannot be reached : this happens a lot on Shipyard map (level 77 top tier map, 1 level below max map level) and if you didn't kill last 5-10 monsters you might just not get a map drop, when you didn't get any map last few monster have a good chance of droping 1 or even more maps      ->** you are kicked from the server and cannot join the map again, these happened twice in a almost half year period     ->* every patch is plagued with game breaking bugs, last time they had to roll back because more than 1000 chars died on hardcore. Even the devs will tell you not to play soon after a patch is released especially on Hardcore  ->4)Challenge system and how it affect the gameplay and drops :   ->* since they added the ""challenge system"" we saw a change on where the unique item required to complete a specific challenge drops : you have Kaom's heart and shavronne's dropping only from level 76+ maps, before you could get them by just farming level 66-67 content for a few months, the price was also lower.    ->* the only reason they added map only unique item drop is because they had 61 people completing challenges before so they wanted to lower that number    ->* only challenge in getting 8 out of 8 challenges completed is getting all the unique items, to get them all you will need at least 250 exalted orbs, let's say you are playing like 7 hours a day 7/7 days a week even you make 10 exalted orbs a week it will take you at least 25 weeks (keep in mind that the first few weeks you will invest most of your currency in upgrading your gear and progressing rather than storing it)   ->*this is not something skill based, if you speak about skill it's not even rewarded in or outside the game. Chris will go and interview ""popular"" streamers instead of ""skilled"" even though they are pretty popular in the Path of Exile scene, not even when we had the first player reaching level 100 (max in Path of exile)   ->* there is a frequent joke made on forums that the only hard part of this game is the Magic Find slider, how much can you get without big drawbacks  ->5) Trading :  ->* you hated action house in other games? well you will hate this trading system even more, there is no proper way to search on forums, both forums and trade channel is filled with spam , people just stay in town and buy/sell both currency or items, this is the same problem Diablo 3 had where people played ""the action house"" instead of the game because it was the best way to get best gear in-game ->6)Balance :   ->* the new monsters hit harder compared to older monsters even though they use the same skill: a monster made before does 5% the monster does 20-40%   ->* moba style of balance changes to skills    ->* even though it was promised in different interviews that there will not be nerfs when someone found a cool builds, that does seem the case, and it went as far removing a skill from in-game (Phase Run) even though it's still on the webpage and a  flask , which was later added back with a nerfed version   ->* at the release 9 unique items were nerfed    ->* every new unique item or skill gem has a drawback, you can say that unique items have at least 2 drawbacks now   ->7) Promises for the release:  ->* we where promised that they will take feedback from players on their forums , but the respond more on Reddit rather than on the main forum, and even with all the feedback they still will do whatever they want, making you just waste your time, it's not just me saying this there are a lot of people that playes  this game since Closed Beta and have the same opinion ->*Private leagues : still waiting on news , it seems they completly forgot about it ->* PvP : might be delivered in next patch , was promised in the release patch like it was for Diablo 3 ->* Trading system revamp : again pushed back to god knows when ->* Act IV : pushed back to march 2014 ->* weekly updates : now updates will be made every 2 weeks ->* optimization : still waiting on it ->* Clans/guilds : you have a guild tag and a chest that lags every time you put or take something out of it, there is actually no reason to have a guild chest unless you want to troll people with the most worthless items you can find in-game . there is no guild banner or shirt or any customization whatsoever to it ->* custom rogue exile through steam workshop : again no news about itAt the current state of the game i wouldn't recommend it, maybe in 1-2 years it will be better but until then my journey in Path of Exile",0
2485,Path of Exile,2015,"Stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. Path of Exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. No pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. Path of Exile was meant to be the Diablo 2 successor that I've always dreamed of... but is it?The first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. The character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. Skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true ""Diablo"" formula. There's plenty of strategy to implement here. I thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.But where did it all go wrong?The second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. ""Cruel"" difficulty is terribly unbalanced. You will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. Heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. Regardless of how you die, you will lose 5% of your experience on this difficulty. This function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. Diablo 2 did this, except the game is 15 years old, and 15 years is enough time for game developers to realize ""yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience"". Grinding Gear Games didn't get the memo, it seems. Regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and ""cruel"" penalties. My desire to play was crushed once I was met with this awful formula. As an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by 20%, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.Due to this massive difficulty boost, you REQUIRE a build to survive. There is no free reign to design your character anymore; you must now look to the net to guide you. Unlike the first playthrough, progression is limited to this, and the experience is totally drained out and dried up because of it. Progression is a massive part of what makes this game and others like it fun, and with this unnecessary and poorly implemented slippery slope added, it becomes entirely tedious and stale.... a grindfest (and it isn't even a traditional MMO). It essentially becomes a game like Dark Souls - a game for masochists. A game where you have to throw an unnecessary amount of time, effort, and research into it to enjoy the bare basics of the game. To even scrape by.These are the reasons why I do not recommend this game. The beginning showed LOTS of promise, but once your first playthrough is up, there's no point in continuing. There's no compelling story, no memorable characters, and the first playthrough,the Dark Souls-like gameplay is mediocre at best, and rage-inducing at worst.Thankfully, I didn't spend a dime on this gameplay-flawed package. I hope you don't spend any on it as well.",0

2487,Path of Exile,2015,"It's very difficult for me to write reviews without going into too much detail, but if I could describe this in once sentence, it'd be this:It's a very rewarding, fun, challenging action RPG that is based more around technical knowledge. One last thing, it's also free! No pay to win either. So here's a more detailed explanation about this game:1) The game's concept:Path of Exile is an RPG that emphasizes on one thing: combat. As far as the game's style and aesthetics are concerned, I guess you could say it operates a bit like the Diablo series. Keep in mind I haven't played Diablo, but I just thought that'd be the easiest explanation for you guys to understand. You're using your mouse for movement, combat, and your keyboard buttons for additional combat skills in this game. It's also fast paced as well. And of course, this game also gives you a wide variety of characters to choose from. The characters you play as are based on different methods of combat. As far as combat is concerned, you have your choices of melee, magic, or archery. Keep in mind that the combat is much, much more complex, but I'd hate to make this review a complete novel, so I'll keep the explanation simple.2) While the concept is easy to understand, the extra details are where things get very, very confusing.I haven't played this game enough to know everything. In fact, I have barely scratched the surface. That being said, Path of Exile is a game that DEMANDS you to know your stuff! Here's what I mean:-So basically, there is this thing called the Passive Skill Tree. Every character from the game has their own special place on this skill tree. As your level up, you are given what is called a 'passive,' but I'll just call it a skill point.The skill points you earn on this game are meant to be spent on certain skills on the tree. These skills can range from anything to stat boosts, critical hit damage multipliers, elemental damage increases, and a whole load of others that you'll have to find out for yourself. So the way you spend skill points on the tree works like this:-You don't spend your points on any skill you want. You have to spend these points from the beginning. It is a step by step process.-What you do have control over is how you will carve out your path on this tree, which is dependent on the skills you need.Therefore, what this means is that when you play this game, you NEED to know what your character's build on the tree will be. Are they going to make heavy use of critical hits? Will they emphasize on elemental damage? Those are the types of questions you need to ask yourself when making the build. The skills you choose on this game relate to this. So if you try to 'wing it,' and just think ""meh, I don't really care what skills I pick"" then your character is destined for failure. You come up with an idea for that build and stick to it. Always.With that being said, you can undo your mistakes on the tree. Just remember that there are very few instances where you get them for free, and you will have to use some uncommon items. So you can redeem those points and then put them in areas where you know you'll need them.Making your own build is considered difficult as well, but you can use guides online made by other players. PoE has a large community of players, so you can always look up builds and follow guides to help you.So that's the skill tree in a nutshell for you. But if you thought that was over, wait until you try to understand combat skills.Path of Exile uses these things called gems. Gems either grant you a combat skill, or you use support gems, which support the combat skill gems (not going into detail over that). Armor and weapons have these things called 'sockets.' Sockets are spaces in these items that you put the gems in. In order for support gems to work along with the combat skill gems, they require links between the sockets. So basically, making effective use of these combat skills (which come from gems) means that you MUST find only a few combat skills that your character's build will focus on. The general rule on this game (for the most part) is that you use one combat skill for your main attack, one movement-related skill that you can use to escape dangerous situations, and another to be used as a single attack against tough opponents like bosses. The rest of your skills come from auras or curses (auras benefit you and your allies. Curses affect the enemy)So the takeaway from the complexity of this game is this:-To be effective at this game, your character's build on the skill tree AND the skills you choose to use for this game MUST correspond with each other. For example, if your character makes use of spells and cold damage primarily, those places on your tree should involve areas that upgrade cold and spell damage (among other factors that will influence it)Oh, and your gear must also correspond with this as well. So all I've explained in point number 2 is the most challenging concept to understand for players like me. Only now am I finally understand the concept, but slowly. 3) What about the plot?Path of Exile is a gritty, gory RPG with an edgy plot. Basically, regardless of the character you start with, you were someone who was exiled from your home island (which is run by an oppressive theocracy that takes slaves) for breaking the law. So now you've ended up on this hostile continet called 'Wraeclast."" It's a continent that has been ravaged by wars, and all that's left are the remnants of what once was left of civilization. People are either fighting for survival, power, or both. You're just moving on through the chaos.There are a total of 10 acts on this game, complete with an endless supply of enemies to kill. Personally, I'm not that interested in the plot, but love the gameplay. Should be interesting enough for those of you who like to read a lot in video games, though. 4) Any cons?Sometimes, the game developers will try to maintain 'balance' on the game. This is because of the use of builds and abilities that would be considered to make the game too easy. So when they try to maintain balance in their updates, this will lead to all of your skill points completely reset. You will, of course, get to spend them all again. You just have to be considerate of where you place those skill points.Also, lately this game has been prone to disconnections. From what I've heard, this is because more people are crowding the game's servers, so be prepared to have some lagging here and there, and yes, disconnects. Don't worry though, because problems like these are fixed by the devs.Other than that, this game is tight.5) The Bottom Line:If you love a game that will give you a challenge, which also happens to reward you for knowing your stuff, all combined in an action RPG, you will love this game. Just expect to be looking up the PoE wiki, Youtube videos, and asking other players for help in order to better understand it. Sounds like a lot of work, but trust me, you will know it's worth it.",1
2488,Path of Exile,2015,"Great ARPG game. I came for some good ol' Diablo 2 flavour, I stayed for the talent tree (forest might be more accurate), build-enabling items, race seasons, 3-month leagues, challenge rewards and the pure joy of mastering the game's complexity.Worth a try.",1
2489,Path of Exile,2013,"Probably has the best, most extensive and elaborate character customisation of any game, a ridiculous passive skill tree, unique and varied active skill mechanic allowing you to truly make any sort of character you want as long as you're willing to put in the work to get there. Oh yeah, there's a ton of loot aswell.",1
2490,Path of Exile,2013,Greatest ARPG ever made this is what diablo 3 should have been and its a f2p game without p2w options. only cosmetic microtransaction. must try !! just whipser me and i can invite you to my guild,1
2491,Path of Exile,2015,"An excellent action RPG for all Diablo 2 fans out there. For me Diablo 3 was kind of a disappointment, long story short: the loot didn't feel exciting. In Path of Exile I actually expect to find useful items. I constantly find myself getting excited over a rare item dropping and even some basic white items for crafting.Another thing I disliked about Diablo 3 was the auction house, it just ruined the trading aspect for me since it completely removed any and all interaction with other people. Maybe I'm weird but I enjoy discussing prices with other people and actually doing the trading. Even with most people setting up a semi-automated shop via the use of ""Procurement"", you still get to interact with other people and there's bartering to be done.PoE has a microtransaction shop where you can buy cosmetic effects (armor skins, effects for your weapons, pets etc.) and stash tabs. You could argue the stash tabs affect the game in a way that could be interpreted as pay-to-win but I disagree. You can play the game just fine with the free 4 tabs you get by default, you just have to pay inventory tetris a bit more and choose what items you wish to keep more carefully. The skins you buy for your armor/weapons are also transferrable between items and characters, so you don't have to buy another one to apply the effect to another item.The skill tree and skill gem systems allow for a wide variety of builds and I find it nicely flexible to fit whatever I want out of a build at the time. It's more than just unlocking a fireball; you can divide that fireball to several fireballs each dealing a bit less damage but that way gaining more AoE, you can then add other types of damage to it or even make it a damage-over-time focused fireball instead of explosions, if you so wish.In conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good ARPG experience. It starts out a bit slow but trust me, it's worth it and once you get into it, you won't be able to stop theorycrafting new builds to try.",1
2492,Path of Exile,2014,"As a Beta backer, I'm very happy with what GGG have done with this game over the years, Well polished and a really great replacement for Diablo 2. When you start, it can be a bit daunting to look at that huge passive tree before you, but after a time it becomes easier and easier to travel around the tree. Look at guides online, it's completely fine too, see what you can do to tweek it, your first build will always be horrible if you do not get help, but when you do make that one magical build that destroys everything it's extremely rewarding.The Currency in this game is what made me play it for so long, it's so complex but at the same time simple. The haggle game is real and it's so ALIVE, always moving, don't believe that one guy with the fixed prices because this game is ALL about Supply and Demand.This game has no pants, does not matter, you still look like the dog's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ towards the endgame with full bodied armour huggin dem thighs tight.Need more Help?

2493,Path of Exile,2015,"ForewordThis document is not a review as much as it is my individual perception and impression of the game. The singular goal of this writing is to allow an individual who is unfamiliar with Path of Exile to rapidly establish an understanding of what this game really is.To begin any discussion of this game, ask yourself: ""What do I value more, a good experience or a good reward? Am I more experience-oriented with my gaming, or more reward-oriented?"" If you find yourself to be a reward-oriented gamer, you can stop reading now. This is an experience-oriented game. For most players in fact, Path of Exile is more likely to kill your character than to reward you.This is intended to be a light review, so I will compress this message into the following categories: game design and experience elements, gameplay and mechanical elements, RPG and technical elements. I have decided against including anything about the Path of Exile community as it is not directly related to the game itself.Game Design and Experience ElementsPath of Exile is Free-to-Play grind-to-grind Action-RPG that offers the one of greatest gaming sandboxes for building your own unique gameplay experience. It is intended that a player create, build, and tailor a character to then play the game in real-time. I offer a break-down of these labels below.StoryWe can start with the game context. The story of the game is as thin as the lore is impenetrable. I can explain the story: A demonic political figure has exiled you to a nightmare, so you set off to murder him. During your murderous expedition, you put-down legions of monsters, zombies, and mutants as you get wrapped up in the mystery of the nightmare. So that's all good. The lore is much, much harder to explain and piece together. Path is one of those games that has a simple story and a voluminous lore, one can draw comparisons to Dark Souls. The challenge of piecing the lore together is there for anyone who wants it.The GrindNow let's shift the discussion towards the grind, it's time for some raw perception about how this game implements the dungeon-crawler. There are a few things inherent to all ARPG's: cool skills, skill systems, zoned instances, mad loot, tiers of enemies, powerful boss mobs, and farming. Players will be farming in the later levels of this game so that they can survive moving up to higher levels. The game deserves the grind-to-grind label but it's not all bad. This game provides excellent enemy variety with its affix system and the developers continually introduce more new enemies to the game. The affixed monsters that the game generates provides a challenge to all builds as they expose different weaknesses in your characters. Make no mistake, you will be playing to kill monsters in this game, period; but it will be engaging as each new monster situations will teach you something new about your build.BuildsI just mentioned it above and we must speak about it now, this idea of a ""build"". All characters have a build to them. The ""build"" is a character's combination of items, linked active skills, and passive skills. The game revolves around making your build efficient, fun, fast, survivable as opposed to slow, boring, costly, and weak. This is where the experience-orientation I mentioned above comes into play. Players are in charge of creating, building, playing, and tailoring their characters as a project. I will offer a simple example of how an item, a skill, and its passives interact together. The experience of pulling off a sick build is the only reward that this game will give you.F2PLastly for this section, the game is F2P. Go download and play it with no financial investment. Your character will look terrible as you cobble together different items, the business model depends on it.Gameplay and MechanicsMechanicsThis game is clunky, there's no hiding that fact. Path uses the angled top-down view with the camera glued to your character. The player clicks on the screen to move like many other ARPG's (Diablo series, DOTA series, League of Legends), but it isn't as smooth and some people consider it jarring. The mechanics are  decent at best but never below serviceable, I found it to be a trivial acclimation but some mechanics nuts may hate it. Some skills are inherently clunkier than others, but are easy to just not invest in. Over time characters pick-up movement skills and movement speed on gear which clear up most of the issues experience early game.ActionsA build consists of usually one or two primary skills (damage dealers, summons) and one or two secondary skills (buff/debuff skills, movement skills). It is totally customizable to whatever you do but the above is what is typical to good, solid builds. You won't have your hands scrambling around the keyboard to make the game work. Players' hands will (default configuration) rest on the top left of the keyboard near WASD and the 1-5 number row segment.Mechanical ChallengeThe enemies in the game don't demand high mechanical skill to outplay, this somewhat changes with map speed mods and end-game bosses but is fairly uncommon in the base game. The focus of the game is squarely on its RPG mechanics to win you fights rather than kiting and the various forms of tanking.The focus of the game isn't about its mechanics but some may find it clunky.RPG & Technical ElementsWe have arrived at the real focus of the game, this section could be many times larger than the previous sections.I need to stress something here that many players don't perceive about Path of Exile: Defense. This game will absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing murder you and completely neutralize an entire  character build if there is imbalance between offensive and defensive investment in active skills, passives, and gear. All players have the game difficulty scale the same way as they progress, and at a certain point a build with no defense is rendered unplayable. The issue of un-playability is one that is uniquely stressed in this game: players can really ♥♥♥♥ up the RPG element balance for themselves by not getting enough life in their passive tree. Passive Skill TreeLet's talk about the passive tree. I want everyone to know that the passive tree doesn't matter until a player has an idea. Let me repeat that. It just doesn't matter for a new player. A brand new player fires up Path of Exile for the first time and sets off to beat the game. The game happily obliges to this course of action and eventually murders or nearly murders the new player. The new player must be unsatisfied with this result for the passive tree to begin to matter. The player must have the gears start to turn in their heads to begin to have an idea for improvement. The idea for improvement becomes systemic the more the game is played. The systemic idea for improvement becomes a starting point for a build, and it is at this point that the passive tree begins to matter. The passive tree is not up for interpretation or understanding until a player has an idea for improvement. Once a player has this idea, understanding the passive tree is trivial.SummaryFrom a review standpoint, the interplay between the difficulty of the game and passive skill tree understanding is enough to hard-carry the entire ensemble of game design, mechanics, and RPG elements to excellence.Veteran players already have the understanding of all of this. The game itself is a hard-hitting benchmark for how well they can execute their builds. Path of Exile is Free-to-Play grind-to-grind Action-RPG that offers the one of greatest gaming sandboxes for building your own unique gameplay experience.",1
2494,Path of Exile,2014,"Diablo 2 + FF7 Materia system.Solid ARPG with a very fun early game full of experimentation and discovery, and a brilliant end game with great features. A lot of the space between can REALLY REALLY suck though, as you bottleneck your build at the gear level, needing very specific number, color, and connection schemes of slots, and needing those setups on items with decent stats as well.Highly recommended for the most hardcore, and the most casual. Normal players may find themselves bored and leaving in the mid game, or playing a large number of characters and fighting with stash space.",1
2495,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of Exile has been almost nonstop fun since I picked it up in closed beta at the end of 2011. I've put in hundreds of hours over many characters before this game hit Steam. If you like Diablo, you will likely enjoy PoE. This is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2.  Prepare yourself though - this isn't as simple as Diablo 3, and requires a lot more planning, thought, and testing to have an effective build.Math of Exile is a game where you afk in town while reading up on skill mechanics and planning out how you're going to set up your future passive skill points. The mechanics of combat, damage, and character resources (health, mana, energy shield, armor, etc) are very well thought out and make for strong ARPG combat, as a spiritual successor to the Diablo line should be. Early game (the first ~19 levels) has a little more variety than D3 per character, but after level 19 your character will be able to use a much wider variety of skills, provided you can get them from a Master or another player, or find them as drops. Gameplay is varied, but approaching late game becomes a grind not unlike running GRs over and over. I personally find PoE's grind more fun because there's more I can do while grinding, and there's a large, active community in each league, and I can chat and get responses and conversations at any time.Overall it's a modern Diablo 2 experience, with a more emphasis on grinding in the late game than D2, but in each respect is more rewarding than D3's ""more loot, less gameplay"" twist on the Diablo recipe.You will be tested, and you will be found wanting. Just try to survive.Edit: How many expansions in are we now? Four? Four free expansions, three of which are more content rich than the D2 expansion, and all of which have more content than Diablo 3's xpac. Seriously, give this game a go. It's free, it's fun, it's awesome.",1
2496,Path of Exile,2014,"Simply the best D2 sequel ever made. The gem and skill system are unique and clever while the game play is sharp and fast. The player is presented with a constant series of interesting decisions that lead to real consequences in their character's progress. Don't be put off by the freemium thing - like so many other design decisions, Grind Gear Games does it right.",1
2497,Path of Exile,2014,"SUMMARY: this game is, IMO, the best of its kind.---The latest free mini-expansion for Path of Exile releases later today so it seems like a good time for me to recommend it. On the face of it this game is your standard Diablo-clone - but even though it's not as flashy as Diablo 3, its depth, customisation and replayability ultimately make it rise above the competition. The combat is fun and challenging. The game has a slow start (though that's one of the issues being addressed in today's expansion) but once the combination of skills and variety of environments becomes apparent it really comes into its own.The skill tree is huge (really, absolutely massive) and offers countless build customisation options, which is in complete contrast to (e.g.) Diablo 3. You can combine skill gems to give your skills different effects -- sort of like runes in D3, but much deeper. I enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other games in the genre too because of the possibility of crafting and improving any 'trash' item that drops.The replayability is fantastic. New 'challenge leagues' are launched every few months which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting ways. They also usually adjust the balance of the game (it can be a bit flavour-of-the-month-ish) regularly which means that different builds are enticing, and since builds play very differently this also helps replayability. Then there's 'races' - short and challenging events of between 12 mins and three hours which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non-PvP setting. Race seasons run for six weeks or so every few months, with several events per day and unique rewards.PoE is free-to-play but never pay-to-win. It has one of the best business models of any F2P game. Microtransactions are cosmetic or functional (e.g. visual skill effects, stash tabs) and the base offering is among the most generous I've seen in a F2P game. PoE's devs are responsive and down-to-earth, and regularly interact with players on reddit and the forums. Give them your money!There are also plenty of little things - e.g. the game's take on health/mana flasks - which are so obviously better than the implementation in other games in the genre that it's very hard to go back to the impoverished versions of those features in other games.There are still things that need improving - the trade system needs work, for instance, and desync can be a problem in certain circumstances. But these are only small negatives compared to the positives.",1
2498,Path of Exile,2015,"This is a great game with unbelievable replay value. I've only beaten the game with one class so far and I'm only halfway through beating it again with another class. It's extremely awesome for the price--and by the way, it's free!! It's a very easy to pick up game with an extensive skill-tree level-up system that allows you to customize your fighting style based on your class. Not a lot of strategy comes into playing this game so even those unfamiliar with RPG-type games can pick this up really well. I mean, just look at how long I've been playing it.",1
2499,Path of Exile,2015,"One of  (If not) the best F2P Arpg out there.Graphics is decent, And the feel of the game is 10/10.Oh and the first time I saw the talent tree, I nearly fell of my chair.Started playing 6 hours ago, not stoping now :)Hope End game Contents are awesome as well :) ",1
2500,Path of Exile,2016,"Path of Exile is definitely the highest point an ARPG can achieve , it has the build diversity, the difficulty that can make you go mad, the real end game that can be only achieved by really putting the time and hard work on your character, and so much more.GGG is a great company and a model to follow, the game has the best Free To Play model i have ever seen, with constant 3 month updates, nothing you can buy will make you better in the game which is a very important thing, no content needs to be bought which is an even more important thing in a game.The only bad thing i find that is important is, the game is hard to run on shity PC's (my PC is 10 years old  XD) but they have improved that aspect a lot recently and the other thing is the Microtransaction prices, i think for example instead of 50 points for 5$ it should be 80-100, but if they made it that way they must have their reasons.With all that said, the game is awesome and definitely the best ARPG and i'm not seeing anyone doing it better.",1
2501,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of Exile is the best ARPG you will play in yearsIf you are a fan on D2 and feel dissapointed with D3, give this game a tryIf you haven't, give it a try, it is pretty slow at first, but then it becomes the best game you've ever playedAND IT IS FREE",1
2502,Path of Exile,2017,"I'll make my review short and sweet.  This game belongs to my favorite genre... fantasy iso arpg.  I've played nearly all of them over the years.  Others may bring nostalgia and pleasant memories, but Path of Exile is just a love letter from the developer's to that specific genre.  Personally, I think it's the best game in the genre, and it's constantly being updated and improved.  The story is great as you discover the tragic history of Wraeclast, through encountering relics during your playthrough.  The storytelling is uniqe, and it is mostly done through voiceovers so there is very little interference in actual gameplay.   The skill tree is massive and may be intimidating at first, so try going into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and saving it to your favorites, then referring to it when you level up.  You gain skills through gems, as well as ways to improve those skills by linking your gems together on your armor and weapons.  The controls are responsive and intuitive and your skills/abilities make you feel powerful.  PoE is free but not pay to win but you can buy some nice cosmetic items and loot boxes.  I got me some glowy eyes.",1
2503,Path of Exile,2013,This game has the best free to play system.Everything related to the gameplay and lore is free and you can buy ONLY cosmetic items with real money.If you really miss Diablo II this is your game! It is very a complex rpg with endless replayability! One might say its better than Diablo III.,1
2504,Path of Exile,2017,"Best free 2 play i've played so far. Everything is so fun and balanced. Devs are active and they love their game as much as we do. Lot's of cosmetic to buy, but when you love this game so much and considering it's f2p and they need to found the developping, it's worth to give a penny. You should try it out if you like Diablo 2. Everything feels so good about this game.",1
2505,Path of Exile,2014,"If you enjoyed Diablo 2, you will enjoy this. If you loved Diablo 2, you will love this. I think Diablo 3 is fun, but a little less difficult than this game. Path of Exile really puts you on the spot every time you go somewhere. You make a mistake on this hostile island full of murderous creatures and evil beings, and boom. You die. GGG's alternative to ""end-game"" content is pretty interesting too, even though I haven't reached that point yet, and they encourage people to try new things with their ever-changing Seasonal Events, and Races. Rewards just for playing them, no pay-to-win, and plenty of friendly people in-game makes for pretty happy players.UPDATE TO REVIEW: I have since reached endgame content and by all that is ♥♥♥♥ing holy this game is amazing.Far better with friends, too. Since most people like to do so, here's a Pros and Cons setup:Pros:+ Gameplay: Like I described above, the game feels ultimately rather similar to Diablo in how it is played, until you get into the real meat and potatoes of it, somewhere usually around level 30-35 or so.+ Community: The community is amazing. Sure, we'll mess with people and provide peanut gallery level commentary on everything (hell, one of my characters is named ""Cactus_Chucker"" for god's sakes) but we also help out players who are legitimately just asking questions, or learning aspects of the game for the first time. Everyone started somewhere, and not all of us have ~800 hours.+ NOT PAY TO WIN: Grinding Gear Games has absolutely nothing functional that you can pay for aside from storage space. Considering that storage space does not affect your characters in any way, shape, or form in how they are played, how their damage is calculated, or anything, the game cannot be classified as pay to win. Just pay to look dope as ♥♥♥♥ and have all the shiny things stashed away where they'll never see the light of day.+ Co-Op: You can play with friends! It is free! Invite your friends and show them the glory of PUNCHING THINGS SO HARD THEY EXPLODE! (Infernal Blow Facebreakers)+ Hardware Limitations: I run this game on an 8 year old HP laptop. Obviously that means that it isn't super hardware intensive. Makes it easier to play with friends who aren't as up to date on their tech.Cons:- Connection Required: Yeah, this is kind of annoying. Being online at all times makes this kind of a hassle if there are things happening like inclement weather, or other things like repairs on hardware in your area. Not a huge con, but still worth mentioning.- Desync: This one is mostly a ""new player"" problem, and is easily fixed. By changing your connection settings in the Main Menu (note: CANNOT BE DONE WHILE IN GAME, MUST BE DONE BEFORE SELECTING A CHARACTER) under Input from ""Predictive"" to ""Lockstep"". Basically changes from ""game assumes where you will be, reacts from there"" to ""client tells game where you are, game reacts from there"". Saves many deaths.",1
2506,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of Exile is a hack and slash game with one of the most unique customization system. Active skills are not required by leveling up, but as items dropped by enemies and acquired from completing quests that need to be put into an equipment socket to work. Different classes also share the same passive skill tree which means you can build your character however you like it-sorcerer barbarian and melee wizard? sure why not? (corresponding classes in the game are actually not called barbarian and wizard but you know what I mean)These unique settings truly makes combatting and looting really fun. As a F2P title Path of Exile is simply huge with its solid gameplay, great graphics (comparable to D3) and unique system. Anyone interested in hack and slash or rpg in general should check it out.",1
2507,Path of Exile,2013,"A spiritual successor to Diablo 2, though achieving its own level of unprecedented uniqueness to the aRPG genre.

2508,Path of Exile,2013,"Fantastically done aRPG. Don't let the fact that it's free disuade you from playing it. The love and attention to detail GGG has put into this game clearly shines through. If you ever loved a diablo or torchlight game, do yourself a favor and start playing PoE!+3 years after first review:The devs have continued to improve upon and expand this game since release. Roughly 4 challenge leagues occur a year with game play mechanics from these leagues sometimes making their way into core game (Essences are the latest mechanic to be rolled into core) make for a fairly interesting shelf life for this aRPG. They just recently released their revamp of end-game content and are in the process of changing the entire game engine to reflect current day technology. GGG's community managers are highly active on reddit and PoE forums, their customer service is one of the easiest and honestly nicest group of people you could ever deal with, and as a company GGG continually listens to their playerbase and is rather transparent. In regards to gameplay: the one ""downfall"" of this game is that there is almost no hand-holding and most of the mechanics are left for you to discover instead of explained in game. In my experience, it wasn't until I hit roughly 30 hours of playtime that I broke into the second difficulty level. However, it is a game that is rewarding and through wiki and chat help, it is very possible to uncover the innards of the game.",1
2509,Path of Exile,2015,"'loot-based' at its core.... all this game is about is loot. Loot... Sweet... precious... looot!  Having ups and downs as it fares.  Ups being, i was not having this much fun identifying stull I loot since Ultima Online.  No matter what item you pick, it can be utter crap or godly priceless piece of equip.  Downs obviously is, RNG is our god.  With thousands of combinations of properties of items, you are on the wrong side of chance drops will be what you need.  Or what you can sell :).  Crafting is another notable area, here the currency, orbs, is what you use for crafting too.  With few exceptions, crafting is same RNG (maybe even less forgiving one than the loot drop RNG).  That means, not everybody has same purple stuff on him/her, not everyone wants same purple stuff, and everyone must think carefully, whether to use currency for crafing, or actual buying from other players.Last interesting area is build variability.  Not going into details, skill tree is HUGE (read in font 24, bold and red).  Your creativity will get some food for thought here... Just be aware: inefficient builds are no exception and quite punishing end game.   Considering my playtime, I guess the number alone gives 10/10 :).",1
2510,Path of Exile,2015,"A very good hack n slash game (or diablo-like if you want to name it that way) thats F2P but not Pay to win in any way. It becomes a little grindy in endgame but besides that, PoE is a fun game that offers a lot of content for literally nothing.It might become boring if you are not into creating new characters to try out builds or find exploring some areas over and over again boring. Worth at least a playthrough9/10 in my book",1
2511,Path of Exile,2013,"Hands down, one of the best ARPG titles I've ever had the pleasure to play.  And I didn't have to pay a dime.  Didn't stop me from doing so, as the cosmetics are awesome, and often times come down in price during big holidays and season based sales.The game itself features one of the more robust skill creation systems I have ever had the pleasure of playing with, and likely is no where near done making new ways to let players battle foes.  The gear is solid, and the grind isn't too bad up to what is considered the end game.  There is always a stronger fight waiting for you around the corner as well.The music, I HAVE to talk about the music.  Some of the best stuff out there right now, with boss fights being wonderful, and several areas having the grim, dark, and creepy music you would expect from a game such as this.  But even the more sacred tracks, such as the crypt, aka Church Dungeon, sees love, even though its a side area, and man, I could sit there for hours listening.",1
2512,Path of Exile,2015,"PLAY THIS .....Just play itIts a free game you really have nothing to lose,  if you are a fan of action RPG....well if your a fan you have probably already played this game but if you havnt then you need to try it out.  It has a much darker feel and more hardcore than something like torchlight but the company behind it is great they have constant updates and the regular new 3 month leages help to keep everything fresh.This is an easy game to recomend I think anyone that enjoys action rpg's will love it and since its free its not a hard sell.",1
2513,Path of Exile,2017,"Path Of Exile is one of the best games I have played in awhile. It has a short, yet well-designed learning curve. It is a great game for both competitive and casual gamers. Just... look at the hours that people have put into it. It really is a game worth playing.",1
2514,Path of Exile,2013,"Like Diablo 2? Like Titan quest? Want something more dark and adult version of Torchlight? Hate Diablo-buy-to-win-3? Then i've got good news for you buddy!This game HAS IT ALL, and ITS FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE",1
2515,Path of Exile,2013,"Path of Exile successfully captures the spirit of older action RPGs and updates it for an experience that's as visually appealing as it's fun. The combat itself doesn't differ much from other examples in the genre, but Path of Exile distinguishes itself with a unique ability system based on gems and a labyrinthine passive skill system that permits the creation of almost any type of character. Leaderboards, PvP options, and lootable challenge maps spice up the higher level content, and an unusual bartering system staves off inflation in its multiplayer aspects. Best of all, it's free almost to a fault, revealing a compelling alternative path for free-to-play projects to come.",1

2519,Path of Exile,2015,"Hands down the greatest ARPG of all time. And now that desync is gone thanks to the great work of Johnathan and GGG I can say that confidently. I've been playing for over 3 year, clocked over 3000 house, and spent $200 on this glorious game and there's no stop in sight. There's quite a learning curve, but players are generally helpful and plenty of great guides online. Do yourself a favor and at least try it, it's ♥♥♥♥ING FREE. Don't blame me though when you forget to eat becuase you've been playing for 8 hours straight.",1
2520,Path of Exile,2015,"After 2,000 hours of playing this game, I still can't get enough. GGG has to be one of the best, if not the best game developers out there. They've done such a great job with this game. If you like grinding games for better loot, this is for you. If you're new to this genre, you're gonna have to take some time to fully understand the concepts of the game. It's definitely a lot to take in as a new player, but once you've figured it out it becomes so addicting. There's new leagaues implemeneted every 3-4 months, which allows for fresh economies/new aspects to the game. It's my favorite part. The devs are constantly updating/rebalancing the passive tree (which is freaking amazing), so you shouldn't get to in love with any given play style/skill/build. If you're new, definitely follow some of the big streamers so you can stay up to date on decent builds to use for new leagues. There's tons more I can say, but I'll leave it here. Download poe, and have fun grinding!",1
2521,Path of Exile,2018,"This game is fun. If you like action RPGs, play this. If you liked Diablo 2, play this. If you like thinking about character progression and tactics, play this. If you like using your mouse wheel to change camera angle and zoom in from a bird's eye view to a 3rd person view of your character, then we can be friends! The gem system and ""sphere grid"" was a nice change from standard RPGs and I wish more was done with the bartering system (make it more like Fallout 1 & 2 where you can barter item for item and not just for scroll scraps).This is not a pay to win game but if you want to set up a guild expect to drop $10 - $20 dollars. The only issue I experienced with this game was not from the game itself but from how I accessed it. Using Steam the game was laggy/choppy, using the external client from their website game play was smooth. Still this game is a blast and even more fun with friends. Cannot recommend this enough and also it is FREE.You can watch our First Impressions of Path of Exile here ► https://youtu.be/8B9H-k_H7Zg ",1
2522,Path of Exile,2014,"Very exciting, addictive, fun, challenging RPG. The skill gems system is great, the passive skill system is just freaking awesome. The story is just epic and the opportunity to kill the one that exiled you makes it even better. Massive monster crowds, items with mad stats, endless combinations of skills, gear and passives. The fact that this game is absolutely not pay-to-win is something you will rarely see. The only things that cost real money are cosmetic items that don't affect your leveling, damage etc. It's a must try altough some people might find it too hard.",1
2523,Path of Exile,2013,"Great  game, incredibly in depth passive skill tree that leads to great build diversity, and lots of interesting unique items that can change the way you play. The skill gems are a really interesting mechanic and with support gems you can play with them in some really fun ways.",1
2524,Path of Exile,2014,"It´s a good game , the gameplay are similar to Diablo :DAmazing plot , incredible quest and good history.The only negative in this game is when you start the game it long time to begining...",1
2525,Path of Exile,2015,"This game is amazing.  I don't subscribe to the ""this is what D3 should have been"" because it's better than what I thought D3 should have been.  The gems and slots add a whole new element to items and skills.I understand the desync argument, but stay away from melee characters and set up a macro for it and desync is infinitely easier.",1
2526,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of Exile is the best game of it's type in my opinion. It's expansions add very enjoyable twists to the gameplay and the different gamemodes are all fun in different ways. This game gives limitless options in terms of builds and it makes the replayability factor insanely high. I do recommend playing this game through it's own client though, if you already play this through steam you don't have a need to switch but getting your account set up through the website is easier by playing it through the client you download from the website.",1
2527,Path of Exile,2013,"Highly recommended. Best Diablo-style ARPG out there right now and you can play it as much as you want free. I threw some cash at it during a sale on stash tabs, but all other microtransactions are cosmetic.Recommend starting when a new season is about to begin. Start with fresh trading economy, go until your character hits a wall or you get tired of the grind. The leveling up of a new character is my favorite part, so don't sweat having or wanting to reroll. It's normal.And that skill tree! Oh man, so good.",1
2528,Path of Exile,2018,"As of this writing I am downloanding Path of Exile for about the half-dozenth time. I habitually revisit this game after uninstalling it on account of its almost endless character customization possibilities and nearly infinite replay value. It is sufficiently challenging despite the absence of preset difficulty levels.  The array of available loot is overwhelming.  I like the aesthetics and graphical style, voice acting, isometric design and mechanics. In my view it is one of the most finely crafted and intensely creative free games ever developed, and it continues to evolve: every endgame battle is simply a gateway to the next expansion.",1
2529,Path of Exile,2016,"This is what d3 should've been. The best arpg out.. and it's free?! I'd say my 1k hours in this game and all the experiences with it are well worth it. If you are not familiar with arpgs, I will have to say this game appears very confusing with the sheer amount of content the game has to offer. However, this curse can also be a blessing because the amount of customization and diversity is absurd.Not only is there a ton of customization the game has to offer, but the amount of content that GGG produces is enough to keep you entertained like no other game. Path of exile comes out with a minor expansion every 3 months and along side the expansion, new leagues are introduced where you can start a new. The new leagues have a theme to them and introduce new challenging content that players must overcome. Every 6 months, path of exile comes out with a huge expansion.A concern for free to play games is that they are pay to win. Poe is FREE TO PLAY. You cannot purchase in-game currency with money and you cannot have advantages other other players simply because you invested more money in the game. I will admit the 4 stash tabs you are given are not near enough to sustain a storage system in the game, however you can spend $16 to triple your stash tabs, and hey, this game is kickass so why not support it so GGG can develop more content. This game is play to win, not pay. Please GGG, don't stop the development of this marvelous game, it's everything an arpg wants to be. THANK YOU",1
2530,Path of Exile,2018,"I heard about the game, didn't realize it was free and was looking for something to play. I saw this pop up and saw it was free, remembering hearing pretty good things about it I decided to just play. I decided I was going to just try to play mindlessly and go with a necromancer since that would let me play at my own pace and get to know the system when I felt like it since when you have your own small army doing all the work you can take your time and do whatever. I have come to thoroughly enjoy the game and would say anyone starting out should try the same because you can still use magic if you want or not and you can use other weapons or not. I found that being a necromancer, of the 3 characters I have made thus far, is the least punishing because you don't have as much need for strong gear or proper skill order, it let's you ease into the game and try a lot of different things without having as much backlash for making what would be a mistake for another character type. In the end I really like the game and will continue playing it and suggesting it to friends.",1
2531,Path of Exile,2018,"The devs just keep delivering such great content for this free to play game; other than its grindy nature (well the devs are called GGG :D) I don't find another reason why this shouldn't be the best ARPG of all time out there.It takes some getting used to for new players, true, but once you do get into it, it is hard to leave it aside for too long. And while my gaming backlog keeps increasing, I can't help but get back to this game every single league.",1
2532,Path of Exile,2018,"Best ARPG out there, I played plenty of them. Diablo 2 LoD was the first game i really grinded and Path of Exile is a worthy successor to this gem, with a 3 months development cycle. You can count on GGG polishing and expanding their game with every patch. Path of Exile is the manifestation of Endgame, there is so much to do and with every content patch it expands even more.Don't try if you have things to do",1
2533,Path of Exile,2018,"The prime example of ""Free to play - action-rpg done right"" !!!Deep and versatile gamemechanics. Regular updates and expansions.Fast support and big community.

2535,Path of Exile,2014,"Honestly, this game has a lot to like about it. It combines what is essentially the Sphere-grid leveling up system from FFX, the Materia system from FF7, and old-schoolish hack-and-slash RPG styles of Diablo 2, potion-pressing and all. And it's free!However, there are a few elements missing from the game: Likeable characters, or at the very least, legitimately interesting ones; A tangible goal or interesting story; or even a clearly defined sense of purpose. All of these are lacking in this game.The game has a lot of good ideas, but not refined and polished enough. Most of the time I was playing this game, I thought I would rather be playing Diablo 3. It's not a bad game. It's just not a particularly great one either. Very average.5/10 ""Mediocre""",0
2536,Path of Exile,2018,"DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES? XDAwesome game that remindes me of the good old Diablo 2. Best choice if you are not agreeing with Blizzards Gamingpolicy right now.It have its own issues, but its a solide game. ",1

2539,Path of Exile,2014,"Truely a masterpiece of a game. If you love D2, and dislike D3 you will love PoE. The game is familiar, but fresh with its unique spell/move gem system + insanely massive skill tree. Out of all the games I own this is one of two where I will be breaking the hundred hour mark and still having continual fun. If anything give this game a try, because it deserves that at least.",1
2540,Path of Exile,2016,"In my opinion it's the best Action RPG that's on the market right now. It has a grim setting, and a story that's mostly told through environmental bits of lore, but most importantly it has a depth of gameplay that no other ARPG comes even close to. It's the best spiritual successor to Diablo II to date. The first time you open the passive skill tree you are likely to be overwhelmed. There is a web with hundreds of choices. Don't worry, eventually it will make sense. You can obtain respect points via quests and item drops, so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway.Your active skills are acquired by putting skill gems into sockets on your gear. The gems have one of three colours (red/blue/green), that match with the colour of the sockets on your gear. Sockets can be linked, allowing you to attach support gems to your active skill gems. This can do things such as splitting your Burning Arrow into 4 projectiles, or turning your Glacial Hammer attack into an AoE attack that hurts monsters all around you. Later in the game, you can even find support gems that can trigger active skill gems automatically once you take enough damage, or get stunned.Every three months the devs launch a major patch with a new challenge league, which adds new skills, new game mechanics and challenges which offers new loot rewards and cosmetics.The free to play model is truly free to play. You can play all the content in the game without paying a dime. The only way the game developers make money is by offering microtransactions in their store, for cosmetic upgrades that don't affect gameplay. Want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look? Maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor looks. Want your fireball to look like a dragon, there is a microtransaction for that! Want a lizard with a bell on it's back to follow you around like a puppy? There's a microtransaction for that!I have put hundreds of hours into the game (using their native client because I started playing before the game was on Steam) and found buying the microtransactions to be a good way to support the developers so they can continue to add more (and more and more and more) content to the game, while also making my characters look awesome via the cosmetic microtransactions.There are a few non-cosmetic microtransactions available, to upgrade your account with more character slots (I believe the default is 12, so that is enough to create at least one character of each of the 7 classes) and to get more shared stash tabs to hoard all the items you find and share them between your characters. The default you get is 4, which people are starting to argue was enough when the game launched in 2013, but is a little cramped for all the content we have now in 2016. There are also ""premium"" stash tabs that allow you to rename the stash tabs and give their labels colours.The game is free, so why are you reading this review instead of playing the game?",1
2541,Path of Exile,2016,"Considering I have almost zero ARPG experience, my start in this game wasn't easy.You have to be ready to dig deep and learn about the game. How to craft, how to use equipment, skills etc.Once you go through the first barrier you will slowly experience the beauty of this game.The community is one of the nicest I've experienced from the crazy amount of online games I've played.The devs are simply loved by the players, something very rare these days.Game is F2P, and it's genuinely free. You can spend money on skins or other character upgrades which are mostly about the inventory. No Pay to win elements.If you decide to try this game, don't give up in your first hour. It's a very unique experience and I so far loved every minute of it.Also I've nominated this game for Steam awards",1
2542,Path of Exile,2014,"9/10 - Hello Diablo III! This game is almost what the Diablo III should have been. Except this game is free (not pay2win), evolving and has huge and complex skill tree. Only one complaint from my side: Why the hell I had to play 80% of the game with same 2 swords. Rather than blame game it was fault of my luck, but it can still damage ""enjoyment"".",1
2543,Path of Exile,2016,"Had normal life.Decided to download, what was hyped as diablo 2 sequel.Ripped Diablo 3 apart contentwise, and playability wise.Equally lost my income.Now lost.Game is as described.Path of Exile.",1
2544,Path of Exile,2018,"This is a great game. I highly recommend getting this. Any one of the characters that you can choose from has their own unique and interesting ways in which you can choose to play. The graphics for the various spells and effects that happen change with other effects that you can blend into the build that you want to aim for. I would say that my favorite at the moment is a combination of 'Wildstrike', 'Greater Multiple Projectiles', 'Volley Support', and 'Elemental Damage with Attacks Support' with the Unique weapon that I have that believe has the '80% chance to Cause Bleeding' buff (I don't remember what weapon it is honestly. I made a new build around the linked sockets.). I also use the 'Extra Blood' buff that I purchased from the store when I also bought the ""Money Organizer' tab...which I also highly recommend before you start losing hair over the stress you'll go through trying to figure out how to best organize your stuff. Just get the extra tab. Also get the other organizer tabs once you get a few things that you don;t know what the heck they are. Don't sell them. Some stuff is rare that comes up later. Also, don't save up a whole bunch of useless stuff. You are going to find so many combinations of cool things in the future once you get more into the game that you will eventually run into the problem of figuring out where to put all of your unique items. Don't sell those... That comes into play later on too and you will wish that you hadn't. Anyway. Enjoy. This game is a blast.",1
2545,Path of Exile,2017,"As a new player that felt quite overwhelmed at first with many elements of the game, I can most definitely say that this is one of the better free to play games that you can find and arguably one of the best of its genre. RPG games can be very repetitive but Path of Exile finds a way to make the game fun and fresh with its complex, varied and demanding skill systems, classes, items and bosses. Devs listen to the players and the community is great - little to no toxicity and you find helpful people to party with everywhere.",1
2546,Path of Exile,2015,"Path of Exile is the most faithful successor to Diablo 2 that you'll find, including Diablo 3. While D3 took the approach of World of Warcraft's evolution, focusing on becoming more streamlined and more accessible than its predecessor, Path of Exile leans in the opposite direction. It's difficult, it's technical, and it's awesome. Truly, if feels as if everything that Diablo 3 did wrong, Path of Exile does right.The one area that PoE really diverges from the classic Diablo formula is in the active skill system. Active skills are granted by gem items. Skill gems gain experience and level up independantly of your character, and by combining active skill gems with ""support gems"" in equipment with appropriately-linked sockets, the combinations are vast.And that's what's really great about this game. The enormous scope of build variety and character customization. PoE's passive skill tree has hundreds and hundreds of nodes, and over the course of your character's career you'll have over 100 passive skill points to allocate in any direction and combination you see fit. Want to build a huge, muscle-bound Marauder that casts spells and holds wands? Want to create a Witch or Ranger that uses a Cyclone melee attack with a two-handed axe? Go for it. If you enjoy theorycrafting, you're bound to love this game.It's the most technical hack-and-slash ARPG out there, and likely the most unforgiving. The path to 100 is a long, long road, and once you're on the second and third difficulties you'll start losing experience with each death. It might get frustrating, but this is not a bad thing. The challenge and longevity this game presents is a breath of fresh air.And, somehow, the game is entirely free. There is -zero- ""pay to win"" here. You can buy extra stash tabs (though it's not at all necessary, they start you with four for free), but all the rest of the offered microtransactions are for purely cosmetic items. There is no way to get any sort of in-game boost or mechanical advantage by spending money.As a huge fan of the genre, PoE really feels like the most compelling offering as of right now.",1
2547,Path of Exile,2016,"Welcome Exile, im just gonna say this, say goodbye to your good grades, social life, wife and kids, and welcome the hours of FREE to play content (stash tabs are the best upgrade, but not necessary) the rest is up to you, Exile, may the goddess of justice bless your Eternal Labyrinth run.",1
2548,Path of Exile,2014,"Offers a lot of things that Diablo 3 did not. Interesting and fresh currency-based economy, which is a nice change from all those gold-based games. Combat can get a little dull, especially with some of the builds, but it can also be rather fast-paced and fun. /edit. Three years later I'm still here. The game keeps evolving. Being constantly developed and fed new content. Definitely a must-try :)  also don't give up after first few h, the game is massive, a lot of ""fun"" begins when your character gets higher level!",1
2549,Path of Exile,2018,"TL:DR: The best, most fair and truely real free to play-model out there. New League will start in december - be part of it!There is no xp-booster, better weapons or all this ""hidden"" pay2win-items in the store. Just skins off all sorts and diffrent kind of bank-slots (you will be fine without those). Now you might think: well if this is so great free to play it must be a trash game because other companys tell us again and again, that they need the pay2win-shops to be able to sustain a good game. It's the opposite:Path of Exile is a fantastic game. Extremly difficult and challenging. And it get's more love from it's developer than most other games do. The updates and ""Expansion"" (they are called Leagues and are free) are extremly frequent and well polished. Every 3 monthes a new League get's published.The developers are heavy connected with the fans and completly open about everything. There are news, roadmaps and much more on a daily base.Since it's free: why don't u simply try it yourself? Keep in mind though: this is not some dumbed down easy walk in the park thing - it IS extremly difficult. The passive skilltree will blow your mind. You will enjoy your start into the game the best by following a well writen build-guide from the official forum. Pick a build that sounds fun and follow the level guide. It won't spoil the game for you! Because you will keep replaying the story and all.",1

2551,Path of Exile,2017,"This is the reigning king of the hack-and-slash action RPG (aka Diablo clone). It is the best one ever made so far, and is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2. For fans of D2, Path of Exile is in the running for game of the decade.That's not an exaggeration. Even when the game came out in 2013, when it had zero polish and only three acts, players immediately recognized it as a rival to D3 because of its incomparably deep game systems. PoE revolutionizes many genre staples including the skill tree, the entire currency system, how potions work, and much more. Since then, GGG (the devs) added so many features that I cannot even name them all off the top of my head. They added an expanded class system, the ability to make a personal hideout, and overhauled the endgame. Whenever I put the game down for a few months, there was new content when I came back. Every single nitpick and quality-of-life complaint I ever had about the game has been fixed. Now, with the release of Fall of Oriath (Aug.2017), it feels like the game has come full circle and deliver on the potential it promised. I believe the community will only keep growing.",1

You can make literally anything you want, from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder dealing elemental damage. Since i was such a big fan of D2 back in the day, i had to try this game. If you dont want to read all of it, skip to the end.You have several classes to play, the one you pick basically sets where you start on the passive skill tree. At the end of chapter 3, you unlock the Scion class, which is the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want.When you level up you get points you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character stronger. The passive skill tree is truly gigantic, hence the huge variety of choices when building your char.You also get gems, that you slot into your  items. Each gem has a skill, and the gems level up as you do. You can connect gems for extra effects, as there are many ""support"" gems, that dont do anything for themselves but enhance other gems, with damage, skill duration, blinding enemies, extra effects like making melee single target skills splash for targets around, etc. There are 3 types of gems and gem slots, red, green, and blue, red being typically the ""brute"" ones and therefore require strength, the greens require dexterity, and the blues inteligence.This gem system is very versatile, just like the passive skill tree.The game currently has 4 chapters. While chapter 1 and 2 are kinda easy, chapter 3 gets harder, and final boss on chapter 4 is pretty damn hard.So lets sum it up:Pro's:-Easy to play.-Highly character customization. Want to shoot a cone of fireballs as wide as the screen, that also deal lighting and cold damage?  Want to have an army of zombies, spirits and totems? Miss your whirlwhind D2 barbarian and want it back, but now dealing elemental damage? Yes please madam.-Free to play.-Areas change, so each time you replay each area the map is different.Cons:-Visual perks like wings and stuff is paid, like guild chest, or extra chest tabs(but you start with 4 so that is hardly an issue).-Takes a while to learn and master the gem system, but once you get rolling you can make truly amazing things.-Gets kinda boring after a while. So just start another class lol.",1
2564,Path of Exile,2018,Yes. What Diablo 4 could be if Blizzard got their act together. Basically plays like Diablo 2 with a modern day MTX system for cosmetic stuff. The layout is similiar to Guild Wars 1 in that you have MMO-style gathering hubs with instanced areas just for you and your group.,1
2565,Path of Exile,2018,"New Zealand's biggest gem. Grinding Gear Games (GGG) are an amazing consistent company worthy of all the success they've attained. POE is truly a wonderful game you can sink plenty of hours into at any given time, I've always came back and easily gotten back into it with ease. A great ARPG game that holds a high standard.",1
2566,Path of Exile,2014,"Let me start of with the most important point: Path of Exile is the absolute best implementation of F2P I've experienced. I am not hesitant to try free-to-play games out, but I am very wary of pay-to-win or♥♥♥♥♥♥game design caused by a game being F2P. Not once have I felt like any pay-cash-for-me items were being pushed in my face. I'm currently playing through the third and final difficulty, and the game being F2P hasn't gotten in the way of it a single time. While the game is not without its flaws, it is silly to avoid it trying since the financial barrier to entry is $0.With dungeon crawlers there are a few core components that come to mind, that seem to make or break a given game. 1) Replayability 2) Mechanics 3) Skill trees 4) Item dropping/randomization. I will try to briefly talk about each of these issues.In terms of replayability, Path of Exile is fantastic. I got bored of Titan Quest, Torchlight, and Diablo 3 much faster than I have in PoE. I actually hated Titan Quest by the time I finished it, I was just determined to beat it. Diablo 3 I quit during the final difficulty because they were still figuring out how to make the game suck less. Torchlight I just got disinterested in very quickly, although I plan to revisit it in the future.The mechanics are probably the biggest selling point of the game in my opinion. Rarely does casting skills in a game make you feel like as much of a badass as it does in Path of Exile. The punch you get from using some of the skills is quite rewarding. While the gameplay is hampered a bit by lag now and then, by and large the game is very fast paced, and quite challenging at times.The skill trees, gems, and leveling system really are a fantastic piece of game design. I won't try to explain how it works because it is worth exploring and learning yourself. While it isn't without its flaws, I really do love the adaptability the skill trees give you. My second character might not turn out as absolutely awesome as my first did, I feel like I kind of nailed it with my first build. Also, it's worth mentioning the currency system is downright clever.The item dropping and randomization is probably the weak point of the entire game imo. While it isn't completely terrible, I can almost completely ignore loot that drops at this point in the game (~Lvl 55). Most things have such a low chance of comparing to what I already have, that it isn't worth looking. I still do, but it is usually futile. The need to get items with both good stats, AND appropriate gem sockets, is really the core problem. It is hard to hold this weakness against it, as this is something almost every dungeon crawler that exists fails at, especially Diablo 3.The fact that this game is online-only hampers it in the same way it did for Diablo 3. There are definitely lag/sync issues that come up now and then. The ability to play in LAN mode, especially for something like hardcore mode (which I will never ever attempt), is almost essential. This is only a slight gripe, as I haven't even paid a cent for the game yet. I do plan on dumping some money into it at some point, primarily just to support the game/devs.Overall, if you like dungeon crawlers, or even just trying solid free-to-play games, this is one is definitely worth checking out.",1
2567,Path of Exile,2017,"Forced to change this to 'Thumbs Down.'  Just too many problems.-- First, the game now lags and stutters, and they refuse to acknowledge, much less fix it.  No, it's not my ISP, no other game I own does this, and regardless, countless other players have the same problem-- Also the game is worse than ever for having a bunch of boss fights that are just a bunch of 1-hit kills, while simultaneously spamming the screen with NPC trash and visual clutter.-- on the whole, the ""difficulty"" is increased by the cheapest, cheeziest, low-brow methods possible in a video game; just spam spam spam OP NPC zergs and 1-hit-kill bost fights-- Despite what the keyboard warrior fanbois claim, the above two cons are why there is little to no build variety now; you pretty much HAVE to include various things into every build in order to deal w/ the 1-dimensional methods GGG uses to add difficulty-- Another problem here is class balance; some classes are easy-mode, others are a total grind-- The gear system relies ENTIRELY on RNG.  This is inexusable, and cynical as hell.  What kind of dev does that?-- The inventory purchasing / management system is a hassle.  Not done well for a loot and scavenging game.On the whole, I can't recommend this game anymore.  It's mediocre at best, really bad at worst.",0
2568,Path of Exile,2015,"This game is one of the worst ARPGs out here.Non challenging and easy gameplay? Check.Massive and unreasonable difficulty spikes? Check.Being one shotted regardless of your build sometimes by single attacks or by literally aoes who take up entire maps? Check.Uninspired and meaningless quests? Check.Bland environments? Check.Outdated and primitive game systems? Check.As you can see this game has a lot of problems. From meaningless and useless loot which is so common that it will act as a hazzard in actual combat to never receiving anything good. In 30 hours of my gameplay as a Witch, I had received like 10 unique items at least and non were useful for me. Maps were the worst. They are like mazes filled with unchallenging enemies those only purpose is to delay you. System existing in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. Skills coming from items means that you have sea of gems to sort through and to collect even to build hero which you would like. Without literally getting to know every ability in a game, you cannot start your build in a first place. AI could be done better by university's students. Mobs can only attack in straight lines, they lock on the first target which often ends up in a fragile heroes being one shotted. If you play as necromancer, you are in a whole of pain when boss will lock up on you and you will be forced to dodge and run and your spectres and  zombies will run with you. Only skeletons were smart enough to fight reliably enemies. I also got corrupted skeleton summon and the whole game became ""if I can summon my army at the right time"" I win kind of a game. Who could had guessed that summoning literally 40+ skeletons at the time would insta shot some bosses when combined with buffs and sacrifices. Then there are other bosses where you cannot raise corpses and their massive aoe will melt through your summons. Fights are not at all playtested and there isn't any class balance. Some classes are plainly unplayable.Game loves to permamently debuff you, no joke. Your reward for finishing the campaign is that you will be denied picking boss loot as you are instantly teleported out and your stats are forever reduced for your achievements. You are not given decent resist gear and are literally drown in special abilities who can instan shot you. The worst thing is that you take bonus damage from those abilities as negative values are simply immense and it requires overpowered end game gear to even be competitive. Veterans had long forgotten at how terrible this game is with their twink speed leveling.As for story, it is the worst one I had ever encountered. Developers think that simply creating a lot of made up stuff makes them good story tellers. So we no have Japanese level nonsense where main characters are names as: Piety, Sin, Innocence. Where empires are names as: Eternal Empire. This utter nonsense and disregard for the lore makes everything pointless. For example in chapter 2 I literraly on accident had stolen the light of a day. Literally. Then I fought an easy boss and brought back the light...The very next quest was to find lost lover of some worthless chick. Questing and story telling is nonsensical as that. At one hand you are murdering Gods, at other you are doing lowly errands for random fools. Characters are even worse, outside of their tendency to spout walls of meaningless text at you, some of them are so painfully generic and gamey. For example, there is a NPC who is all about the maps. So her voiced dialogue literally is like this: ""Keep your maps safe"". ""Take care of your maps"". Really, how I'm to believe it is a real world with its own story when every person in it is so damn artificial? Things just happen. Your enemies become your friends, because literally they decide they are now good guys. Bad guys impede and fight you just because. I never seen any other game where they would put so much effort into a story and it would emerge so painfully bad. Like every cliche and most horrible writting practices kind of bad. For being this bad you need a talent which is equally rare as being just better writer than anyone else.As for items, you will never get  any. They mostly look horrible and they never drop anything good. My core set was found at act 2 which I never really replaced since. You will look terrible, your will be bombarded with loot, but never ever you are going to get anything useful. Small inventory space, meaningless RNG grinding, massive time wastes. It is MMORPG for ARPG fans who enjoy mindlessly wasting their time and grinding nonsense, putting on with unintuitive and obscure character building systems and want to pretend being veterans and better than others just by sheer virtue of time sink and getting their heads around of poorly made and highly unintuitive systems.",0
2569,Path of Exile,2018,Probably one of the best and worst aRPGs that I have played.  It is great in the aspect that it allows a lot of customization of your character's build and in-turn enables a lot of different playstyles.  The game fails in the aspect that it the playstyle you choose - you are effectively stuck with.  There is little tactical about the combat in this game outside of spamming what your build is good at and then hoping for the best.,1
2570,Path of Exile,2018,"Cant find another great ARPG like it and it scares me. Best ARPG of the decade, and this is where character building gets fun if you dont like to follow build trends. i just started about 3-4 months ago and im hooked. Feels like Diablo 2 on steroids. Im glad i gave it a real chance.PS with all that said, best free-to-play game ive ever touched. ever. this game made me believe in god.",1
2571,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of Exile is a great game, i have been playing off and on since beta and its done nothing but improve since its beta, from awakening from a wreckage, to the end of your journey through Wraeclast, (i have not reached it yet i got to act 3, my witch is not as fun as she used to be so im starting a new character) the game is non stop fun.Pros: Huge skill tree, build your character however you want.Plenty of characters to choose from.Very interesting story in my opinion, the team is constantly updating the game, in fact the Forsaken Masters was just released.The game is very much alive.Friendly community.Great looking game.Its free.Cons:NoneRating: 10/10",1
2572,Path of Exile,2013,Well it was fun for 90 hours but then it dawned upon me. To truly master the game you have to pick a skill and make a perfect path for it and perfect gear and both of those take forever and a day,1
2573,Path of Exile,2014,"Think of the elements that made Diablo II great, meddle it with Torchlight and add some new stuff: the result is Path of Exile, a game that is far too good to be a free to play game. You don't even need to play anything to become superior to the other players: the microtransactions are moslty cosmetics. There are paid games out there that don't have 10% of PoE's quality. Everything in this game is perfect; only the story is a little confusing and uninspiring, but the lore is pleasant. From the reliable community to the constant patches, this is a very friendly game, both for you and for your low-end PC. Without prolonging this review a lot more, let me just say that it took me about 20 hours to do a single playthough, which is a lot more than some AAA titles present. If you like ARPG, or just RPG, or even just a action game, there is no excuse for not to, at least, try this wonderful game. I give it a 92 out of 100. Best free to play game of 2013 and probably one of the best free to play games out there.",1
2574,Path of Exile,2016,"So far my experience with Path Of ExileFirst of all I am going to say that i love to play games by my self and this games be compleated by your self!When i started to play this game i was like ""What is this"" "" what is that"" ""what does it do?!"" But the more you play this the more you will understand how everything works!But if you plan to play with your friend, this would mean that monsters HP grows making it harder and more challenging to do with your friends, but also much more fun!Lastly the only disadvantage that i have for this game is the map, the map dosent seem that big, but because i completed all ""ACT's"" then i had to start over in ""Corrupt"" world. Corrupt is the same map you play on the normal difficulty, but corrupt is much more harder than normal, and the loot is much more better than in normal world.",1
2575,Path of Exile,2013,"Not only is this the finest free to play game ever made, it is also one of the best Action RPGs of all time. Path of Exile easily stands alongside the greats of the genre and surpasses Diablo III in nearly all ways. There is really no reason why anyone should not give this game a try.",1
2576,Path of Exile,2016,"In my honest opinion, Path of Exile is the true spiritual successor to Diablo 2 | Lord of Destruction.When I originally found PoE in closed beta, I was immediately taken by the team at Grinding Gear Games dedication to their project. I could feel the passion seething from them as I watched videos featuring the Devs expressing their plans for the game and what they aimed to accomplish. As a seasoned PC Gamer who has spent thousands of hours enjoying the Diablo Franchise, as brought to us by Condor, AKA Blizzard North; I was immensely excited for the launch of Diablo 3. In fact, myself, my girlfriend, and two of my friends actually sat outside Futureshop smoking herb and drinking gin (seriously) from about 9PM until the Midnight Launch. We all bought our Collector's Editions (well, I actually bought a box of 6.. knowing how good the extras were and how limited the CE was)... anyways.. we return to our homes excited to begin our journey in the new Diablo... only to find that BlizzTURD and CRAPtivision had fu*ked the doge... and NONE of us could install due to server issues! We literally had to break out Diablo 2 |  LoD to get our fix that night! That was the start to a very very bad launch of Diablo 3... a game that ""lead director"" Jay Wilson completely destroyed. I personally witnessed many people politely and eloquently express their concerns with the game direction (WoWified... shi7 loot systems.. repetative and linear gameplay.. the list goes on..) get PERMANENTLY banned by the forum admins, actually removing their access to the game they had purcahsed, seriously.. should be CRIMINAL what the blizz dev's were doing.. and I specifically remember one of the BlizzTURDs ""Bashiok"" who was relentlessly banning people. The inhuman garbage at Blizz responsible for the turd known as D3 have permanently tarnished both BlizzTURD and CRAPtivision for me personally.. and I'm glad they did... because it helped convince me to invest over 600 USD in supporter packs for PoE... I don't regret one cent.. I only wish I had invested more to had my own unique added to the game!Path of Exile is a magnificently complex game with beautiful artwork and an exceptional story line. Amazing what GGG have managed to accomplish, supporting the entire development with ethical microtransactions (cosmetic only, not pay2win)Solid 10/10 game. Magnificent.",1
2577,Path of Exile,2015,"One of the greatest concepts ever. The highly customizable builds makes this game sometimes a bit too much enjoyable actually, beside the fact the desync is a thing since release. Desync is really a thing you need to admit to at this game and if you can't you'll end up ragequitting anyways. Had the most fun I've ever had in a game with a build (Facebreaker Cyclone) which actually 'caused desync quite a bit and it didn't irritated me at all to be honest. The gem system is really worked out well and the replay value of endgame is amazingly high. Don't expect to see other mobs or other maps a lot, but expect to see dangerous and deadly combinations of these two a lot if you wan't to risk it! You need to make this game enjoyable yourself by asking help of others as well, the game is kind of hard to get into but once you're in it's hard to get out. This game is one of the definitions of addiction and dedication but it's totally worth it. I would highly recommend to start the game in a heroic league, the best way to learn is failing in this game!",1
2578,Path of Exile,2015,"Lag die like♥♥♥♥♥♥simulator .This may be the worst server I ever played.I thought that DS II server is the worst server in this world but this game is beyond that.Frankly it's just a poor programming.It's just a bug that move you to the center of mobs and you still don't even know that you were tranformed to that point.When you knew it,you have already dead.Even for new protocol name Lock step did not help you so much ,yeah you won't die because of lag and desyncronization but you would die because of slow respond scene.it has become delay instead of lag.Let's come up with the game mechanic.First the over size 1500+ passive skill may seems to be so impressive but actualy the mass passive skill tree did not do a damn thing it's just add up more and more attributes to your stats but they affect the playstyle very few.The most important thing is legacy gear which is really help you so much.You are really need to equip with legendary gear and all of things that you have done before is useless.The skill support gem building system is very impressive for me but in the end there is no need at all when you got all legacy gear.You just rush in and spam one skill with massive damage and you won't die so easily except lag.What's the point of great system which you don't need to use it anymore when your character has become OP.I do really want to support this game but I can not afford it with this lag.",0
2579,Path of Exile,2014,"The best thing you can say about this game is that its free and when I say free its 100% free in no way will not spending hold you back at all.That being said why play a free game if its no fun? The game as most of its type is grindy but thats fine if the story is good or the dungeons varied. In Path Of Exile the story as far as I got was well not a story rather just a few npcs who would make a funeral more depressing and you keep finding yourself skipping the text before you fall asleep.The Dungeons are no better, maybe the lead dungeon designer got bored after making three types (underground, forest, coast) and thought no-one would notice.The lvling up system is quite interesting using a final fantasy type spider system allowing millions of different combinations which would allow for hundreds of styles of play but in reality only a few will work for every character, so caution is required as making a mistake on your leveling pathway could mean you end up with a dud many hours later.Expect for that it really is just a standard ARPG with poor graphics that even free is not recommand over Van Helsing or Torchlight.",0
2580,Path of Exile,2018,"I really love a lot about this game, yet I find myself not returning to it. I canno't run through the campaign even one more time. Im burned out of the same tedious campain over and over. We need an option, say after one character completes the campaign the new characters also get it. I buy packs to support the company and love the business model, but can't play anymore. My friends and I look forward to end game, then are burnt out by the time we get there. The leveling is not bad, the quests are super tedious. Please help me return to this wonderful game.",0
2581,Path of Exile,2018,"I have over 400 hours into this game, and while I enjoy it... I hate it at the same time. Allow me to explain:The ARPG genre is about getting lots of loot, killing lots of bad guys and feeling like your character is progressing into a powerhouse. Path of Exile is the top of the line ARPG for customization... But it's a trick.You see, as you progress in the game you don't become stronger, but rather it seems weaker. Because as you progress the game takes your defenses away from you, forcing you to stack more and more, which results in the feeling that you're fighting the developers. The game has Fire, Lightning and Cold elemental resistances, all of which have a default cap of 75% (this cap can be raised by specific pieces of gear, and very few skill tree nodes.)Now, as you progress half-way through the story, you lose 30% resists - Yes, if you have no armor on at this point, you are -30% to all of your resistances, meaning you take 30% MORE elemental damage. As you beat the campaign and begin the real endgame, you lost another 30%. Elemental Resists in this game are immensely important, and rare to find on gear - Especially Unique (Legendary) items. So to even stand a chance of not being instantly killed against the weakest of end-game enemies (not bosses, I'm talking the stuff you should at this point be 1-shotting) you need a total of 135% resists to Fire, Cold and Lightning on your gear. That isn't to fight the final boss, that's to fight the mobs that you want to farm to get the gear to fight the final content... Thus fighting the developers.The game has a massive skill tree, which looks like insane customization, but there really isn't. If you try to take a creative path and build a unique character, you MUST follow certain paths to get the defenses you need (in the form of increased Life or Energy Shield (pseudo Life)) or you will die instantly in the end-game content. This immense defensive need greatly hinders the customization the skill tree would add.I love the game's potential, but at this point, fighting the devs to even survive is mundane and quite frankily, very frustrating. If you aren't willing to dump immense amounts of time, and stress into this game, don't bother playing past the first few acts, it becomes a job as opposed to a game. I've tried to enjoy this game because I love ARPGs, but the defensive battle is simply not fun.",0
2582,Path of Exile,2017,"I've absolutely been amazed at the progress this game has made since it was released. At that time I felt it was the Diablo 3 that should have been released by Blizzard. It has superb gameplay, decent graphics and was every bit as good as top tier action RPGs.Since that time, my love for the game has not waned. With every update, they add more content, new items and quests, NPCs, etc. For a free game, it is simply the best. One of the best aspects of the game is- NO PAY TO WIN!! Grinding Gear promised this would never be play to win, and it still is not four years later, yet the game continues to expand. All you can buy through microtransactions are cosmetics, pets that don't help you fight in any way, and supporter packs. I don't mind buying little enhancements to my character's looks just to support devs who have actually stuck by what they said, and continue to give fans a reason to keep coming back to play the game. Keeps  me working for that dank loot! The story line isn't bad either, with great voice acting. If you like Diablo, you'll also appreciate and enjoy POE. It's one of the best out there, and for a free to play game, you just can't ask for any more than that.Keep it up GG, you are making a legacy here that will be around for a long time I feel.",1
2583,Path of Exile,2015,"Overview: Path of ExileThis game is technically an MMO, but you will seldom encounter other players unless you choose to invite them to a squad with you. If it weren't for global chat, you may or may not realize that anyone else even owns the game while you're not in a major city. The gameplay is very dungeon-crawler(esque) with a good deal of lootfest and skill tree elements. Storyline: lol didn't read it, nobody has time for that (doubting anyone has time to read reviews either, but these devs deserve the time it took to give the review). Difficulty: initially there is only a normal difficulty, but a character can access a higher difficulty (cruel, the merciless) after beating the quest line on their current difficulty. Additionally, you can create normal or hardcore characters, the difference being that hardcore characters recieve better loot, but on death, they convert to standard characters, and all their gear becomes standard gear (and cannot be traded back to a hardcore character).Pros: 1) Microtransactions aren't needed for late game.. in fact, there is nothing you can buy with money that results in an in-game advantage beyond a larger storage chest. 2) Character Balance and Variety. There are nearly infinite amounts of viable character builds and skills, not just 2-3 ""use these or always lose"" web builds for ""op classes"" - from what I've seen, the classes are surprisingly well balanced.3) Community. There are usually a lot of people chatting in global, and many people are willing to provide help either in-game or just give advice on items if you're inclined to ask. As always on the internet, there's a healthy amount of salt, and a few trolls, but such is the price we pay for gaming with other people.4) Audio. The ambient sounds and the soundtracks for the game are both excellent, and the character attack sound effects manage to avoid being irritating although you end up hearing the same ones hundreds of times in the course of an hour.5) Details. The devs clearly spent enough time in other games to understand what's annoying in an mmo, and they did their best to remove those elements. Most notably, potions don't clutter your inventory - instead, you can carry up to 5 potions, which refill as you slay enemies. The game doesn't have currency, instead players trade with chaos/fusing orbs, materials which can actually be used to upgrade items, rather than exclusively be used for buying and selling.Cons:1) Repetition. Although the creatures and attacks change, but essentially every level plays out the same. It's quite grind-heavy in that even if you progress through new areas as soon as you finish the quests, the actual gameplay remains redundant.2) Actually.. being bored by the redundancy of combat is my only complaint. Although boredom is a death sentence in most games, I think I'll still keep playing this one... and even if you do quit if you become bored, there's easily 20 hours of early-game content which you'll probably complete before reaching that point.",1

The ability to MAKE ANY BUILD you want is just simply the greatest. My cons: Poor optimization, an SSD and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable FPS.The highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. It's doable but likely expensive for solo players. Not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.There is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new Lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. The lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't  gamebreaking unless you have a bad PC.Overall, if you've never played an APRG like this before, it make come off as too hard. The hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. What items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. All of this stuff simply takes TIME to understand. I've played this game since closed beta, on and off. I learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.This game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. This game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. This game is SUPER competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. Racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.The content updates are constant, the gaming company, Grinding Gear Games are simply the best of the best. On par with Valve and sorta kinda Blizzard-8-years-ago. There are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.If you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. But you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. This is always the biggest issue I see with new players. This is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.Don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to Diablo 3. It isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. Make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.If you're my friend, hit me up, I will do everything I can to make you realize this game. It's fun, I love it. Oh and it's 100% free to play. There is no pay to win. Extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. That said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what 100 stash player can compared to a f2p 4 stash tab. But it does make life easier.",1
2589,Path of Exile,2016,I highly reccomend Path of Exile to anyone who loves ARPG games like thisIts extremely addicting with practically infinite gameplay possibilitiesIt is a little overwhelming to new players but once you get into it more it is HIGHLY worth playing! ,1
2590,Path of Exile,2015,"The Real ""Diablo 3"" Very Enjoyable  experiance ARPG.i originally backed this in the closed beta stage and the game has gone a long way since then.highly recommend to anybody to try it.",1
2591,Path of Exile,2016,"TL;DR at the bottom.How should I start this off..Well, this game is a free MMO Hack N' Slash type game, with a large skill tree and many builds/characters you can make to destroy your opponents with. When it says free, it truly means free. The only thing NOT free, or Micro-transaction, is the trails & certain masks as well as storage. So, in my opinion that really means it's free. Because, you aren't forced to buy anything to do certain quests, or to proceed in the game. It's a well rounded Hack n' Slash game with very unique & clean combat. The skill tree is complex, and a build guide is highly recommended for all new players. It may seem a little... Extreme the first time you open the skill tree, when I first saw it I wanted to run away and hide under a rock, but it's really nothing to be scared of. You will be met with people in the chat talking about 6L's and Unique weapons, and weapons with certain stats etc. The only real learning curve to this game is asking people what it means, or using the PoE Wiki, which for new players I would say is extremely helpful. Get this though, I don't know everything about this game.. AT ALL, I am still learning a ton of the mechanics and the functions of certain things.Pros +Free to play.+Complex & intriguing passive skill tree.+All around great game.+Extremely addicting and worth the download.+Actually FREE TO PLAY. Don't have to spend money to pass quests.+No membership.Cons-A small learning curve than will generally take about 8 - 9 hours to learn the more intermediate stuff. Some great guides on the internet about it!TL;DR Version:Great game, amazing skill tree, actually free to play! So what are you doing here?! Go play it!",1
2592,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of Legends is another great indie game to add to EA's records of acheivement. You start of with a selection from various characters, these include lulu the dark witch, taric the holy one, and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger. I myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there. In any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates. Yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time. unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child. Yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault. Amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game. Theres nothing much to it at first, you are lying face planted in the dirt. You learn to survive as you craft with various tools. Immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands, but i suppose this could be attributed to Yi being a badass and so it can be justified.Eventually you can build yourself a nice hut, and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost. You get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up, but i never was a fan of DLC so i dont support EA's decision to monetise indie games like this. After you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss, a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of Yi's personal struggles from his japanese heritage. the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist. beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section, where you meet rico from just cause 2.    Rico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game. Fortunately for us, Yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly. the hook allows you to make it to the central island, where the plot thickens once Yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment. Yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner, but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life. The game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on. You need to take out key military instillations over the island (such as propaganda stations and fuel depots) to try and win over the local populus. Once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island.THe final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the HQ, which span deep underground. Yi uncovers the secrets this place holds. the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship, hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about. This clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise. The artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by Tom ultman. From this point on Yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go... space... THe game ends with Yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility, or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons. Once you make your choice you can hitch  a ride on the ebon normandy, a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight. YOu can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island, or just go solo. In any case, you leave the island and make your way to eden prime, and this is the basis for the second installment of league of exiles which we here at indieholic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on.until next time, stay snazzy gamerz!",1
2593,Path of Exile,2013,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07B4SbJLPzk&list=PL0E56219EE956754EPath of Exile: An action RPG similar to style and feel of great titles like Diablo 2. Path of Exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. Everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other ARPGs. From the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of Wraeclast itself, it’s a unique enough experience that I haven’t encountered anything quite like Path of Exile before. Its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of ARPGs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement.  The game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. The story and lore of Wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most ARPGs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. The game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other ARPGs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. Overall the experience of Path of Exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. Personally, I would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. As a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully I can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. Items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these won’t feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. Path of Exile is a great ARPG, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers 20+ of content for a first time through the entire game and it’s all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork ",1
2594,Path of Exile,2014,"Fun game and unlike a lot of Free to play games can be fully enjoyed without spending anything.EDIT: Looking at this game some months later and I still think the ""Real"" money aspect is completely optional. Not spending money does not this game any less fun. Sure you can spend some money but I feel I did that more to reward the devopler than to become OP.",1
2595,Path of Exile,2015,"*Gets handed a Microphone*What...Path of Exile? Wh- NOW!?...Okay...Uhm...It's better than Diablo! 10/10....What more do you want from me at this short no- WE'LL DO IT LIVE! W-WE'LL DO IT LIVE DAMNIT!#I Want Malachais SpikeANYWAY, What's Path of Exile? It's Diablo, done right, pretty much. Yeah I know some of the fanboys are PROBABLY going to downvote me for this, but it's still true. The game is free, and is more dynamic and polished than Diablo ever was. That can be a bad as well as a good thing...With Diablo you don't get in-game stores cause you already paid for it a-...Wait you can buy stuff for it on battlenet?...Well...Uhm...okay!The game's pretty much you picking one of 7 different classes...From brute monster dudes to a creepy witch gal, and then you get pitted against four chapters of various horrifying and SUPER edgy monsters, while being forced to tackle the most INTIMIDATING SKILL TREE THAT YOU WILL EVER EVER SEE FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!![i.imgur.com]. Seriously, it's flipping mind blowing! There are dozens of different paths to take and things to do and stuff and what have you! It's outrageous! And to add insult to injury: There's no tutorial what so ever! After getting to a certain point in the first playthrough, you unlock a jack of all, ace of none character, named Scion, who's pretty much a blank slate character. Do what you want with type of deal.The graphics are a-okay and it actually gives you a wide range of spec requirements...the recommended is nice and high and lets even the toughest rigs get to make the game into a gorey HD experience, while the minimum are so low that even the worst old crappy laptops(Like my own) can play it with little to no complications!Once you've completed the game on normal difficulty....you...GET TO PLAY THROUGH IT AGAIN!...This time on cruel difficulty, and then merciless!!! Yes, you have to backtrack the same stuff you just did if you want to level past 35-40 -.- Cause thats when you reach the last bit of chapter 4 and the game starts from scratch 1 difficulty level higher.But it's okay cause you'll NEED to know how this stuff works anyway! Normal difficulty is more like a 'let me show you how its done' stage, and cruel difficulty is actually the INTENDED difficulty of the game! Or that's the feeling I got from it, anyway.So now lets do some pros and cons...Pros:It's better than Sakura ClickerYou have the most freedom skill wise than in any other game that I've ever seen.Large assortment of classes to choose from, including one ace of none jack of all character to unlock.Very large community, which is commonly adultThe game is INSANELY gorey and kind of horror based. Lots of impaled corpses and body parts and literal RIVERS of blood. If you're a gorefest lover, you'll ADORE this game!Naked golden statue women with really nice golden asses...BIG plus for that one.PvP is a thing!Crazy difficulty curve...Easy at first, IMPOSSIBLE to solo at the end.A real e-peen fertilizer! You feel you have a boner that could lift your desk when you're wrecking parts of the game that shouldnt be soloable, by yourself!You can raise the dead to fight for you, then make them explode when they die, then raise the dead who just died to your zombie minions...It's AMAZING!!!Cons:The currency system is a complete mess...It's based on 'orbs' and there are literally 15+ different orbs to keep track of, each more valuable than another and WHAT value they exactly are switches from day to day and from person to person, so you might buy something for 10 regal orbs but can only seem to sell it for 5 etc.How good you are is RNG based. When you get a good piece of gear, it might not fit your needs exactly(You might do lightning dmg mainly and the piece has cold dmg!). So you use an orb of chance or whatever it is to change the attributes of it to fit your needs....And you might end up making it WORSE, like putting strength on some mage gloves or something stupid like that! Being good in this game relies a LOT!!! on luck of the draw.Repetitive as all hell.You play through the game...next difficulty...Play through the game...NEXT difficulty...OH there's an event! Make a new character, play through the game, event ends, new character again, new league to get better get...Play through the game, next difficulty, league ends, character gets put in hardcore league....If character died, character's bumped to standard league. Make new character etc. It's the same exact stuff over and over again.Bit of a random storyline.It's kinda hard to follow the lore of the game, as it's all kind of just thrown at you as you go along :\ Unless you sit and waste 30 seconds - 3 minutes reading dialogue from NPCs, you will have NO IDEA whats going on, or why Merveil has to die, or why Malachai is a grade A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, etc.Other than that, the game is, for its few, not super crippling flaws, a really good one, and I do indeed recommend it.",1
2596,Path of Exile,2014,"This game blows me away. How can this be free to play and yet be so good? I played the Diablo III demo, but I don't think I'll ever buy it. Instead, I'll happilly spend my time on PoE. The enormous skill tree, the fact that your attack skills and spells are gems instead of class abilities, the barter economy, the gritty style: this is what Diablo III should be. A game for people who aren't afraid to think and experiment.",1
2597,Path of Exile,2018,"Content, making new character, lots of builds. Every expansion add to the game. At first overwhelming with all the skills, loot, skilltree etc. Once you start dig into mechanics and playstiles you start to enjoy. Its the arpg game out there. Constantly evolving. Started to play a long time ago but could not get into it at first. Took a good look at it 1+ year ago again, liked what the game had become and really like where its going. While free to play there is a hoarder in all of us so you probably will end up paying for a bit more stash. Not a big deal i think, value for money - yes. After all i probably would spend more money on another game that would be uninteresting after 2 weeks.",1
2598,Path of Exile,2015,"Started playing when it first released in 2013, but quit right after a few days... My mind was looking for the old-school-Diablo-Like-ARPGs, I was looking for gold and loots, and thought POE didn't even have a proper trading system.After 2 years, I've found myself a mature gamer, re-join POE when steam suggestion pop this game up at my screen...And now I have crazy fun with skill varieties, new hideout and forsaken master systems are addicting, and damm, I still could log in with the account created 2 years ago and link to my steam achievement... And it is still free to pay!!I play, I pay and I rejoice in this forsaken ghost land.p.s. Just spent USD $100 on Journeyman Supporter Pack, and I am now trying to think of any reason that can stop me upgrading my Supporter to the next level...Chief Charr Charr ",1
2599,Path of Exile,2016,"Seems complicated, and it is. But give it a chance, it is much more rewarding than any other modern ARPGs. The variety of builds is astonishing. Highly recommend it, but it is a time sink. I spent over 900 hours in this game and still didn't see anything.",1
2600,Path of Exile,2013,"This free title is the best action rpg out there. The items, the gems and the currency system are all very interesting to play with and we're not even talking about the massive passive tree. You don't need to play the hardcore mode to enjoy it but for me it's a must.",1
2601,Path of Exile,2017," Single-handedly redefining a genre is an amazing feat. Especially as a F2P game I have played Path of Exile on and off since it first launched on steam. I always could see it's greatness, but there were things putting me off, like the horrible netcode and desyncs. After starting again with Patch 3.0, I could not resist recommending this game. To make it brief: It is epic. Imagine Diablo 2, but amplified in every way with dozens of systems and mechanics to keep you motivated, while the combat feels as responsive and impactful as diablo 3  Story Path of Exile takes place in a very unique fantasy setting. You as the player get stranded as an exile on the magical realm of wraeclast, which is kinda the game-worlds way of sentencing you to death. But you are no ""normal"" exile and soon discover, that you are capable of great power by using mystical gemstones. I don't want to go into too much detail, but for an action RPG, especially a F2P-ARPG, the background is amazingly detailed. The story-telling is somewhat Souls-esque, with NPCs, item descriptions and randomly spawning audiologs giving information to the player which has to be puzzled together to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the world. Atmosphere & Setting Building on the mystical background-story the developers have created a dark and grim world for the players to explore. Objectively, there is a huge variation between zones and acts. While you start on the rough coast of Wraeclast, you soon move into muddy swamps, through dark caverns, fight through jungles, discover old overrun cities and fight in pompous palaces. The variety is excellent and some areas, which lead up to certain bosses, are very rich in atmosphere. On the Downside, I feel that the variation, which is definetely there, feels not as distinctive as it could since almost all areas are somewhat dark and gloomy. I get that this is an artistic choice to reenact the style of world that Diablo 2 was building, but sometimes I catch myself being bored with the sorroundings although they are, again objectively speaking, mastefully crafted. Gameplay On the surface, the Gameplay of Path of Exile is cookie-cutter ARPG: Run through areas, click monsters to death and get sucked into the addiction of finding better loot until you hit maximum level and grind the s*it out of randomly generated endgame-content. Below this surface, there is an unprecedented level of complex systems to keep you occupied. For starters: At the start of your journey, you choose between 7 different classes, but despite genre-convention, your class choice doesn't really lock you into skills and playstyles. Since the active skills aren't learnable on a skilltree, like most other ARPGs do, you could potentially use every skill the game has to offer with every class you choose at the start. Every active skill can be dropped in the form of Gems which then have to be socketed in your equipment to be used and also can be leveled to increase their power.So no skill tree you ask? Oh boy, there is one, and when it comes to skilltrees, it is the mother of all skilltrees. It is enormous, complex and challenges the player in ways, that no other ARPG has challenged you before. Mostly offering passive bonuses and playstyle defining key-abilities, you have to carefully think about investing your skillpoints. But there is always a way for you to switch passives, if you feel like you have missplaced some points, which I feel is an excellent compromise between forcing the player to make smart choices, but also giving you the opportunity to correct mistakes, you may have made.Currency is also a biiiig part of the game and works different to almost any other ARPG: Instead of gold, you can sell items for different Orbs, that you will need for crafting and improving your equipment. These orbs are not only currency between you and the NPCs but can also be used to trade with other players. Player-Trading is vital and the community is very active, so you can always spend your time trading with others to get the gear you desire.What has to be said though is this: Path of Exile is hard. Not only is it hard when it comes to the challenge of beating it's content (and believe me, that in itself is a tremendous challenge), but it also has a steep learning curve for new players. The tutorials they implemented work, but they're in form of texts  and the player has to actively read all of the tutorials to understand the mechanics and systems. Luckily the community is helpful and there are excellent video guides on youtube to get you started. Controls The controls feel tight & responsive in most cases, which is elementary for ARPGs. In the past, I always had my problems with POE since I felt that the netcode was bad, that the game had too many lags and desyncs to be thoroughly enjoyed. I am happy to report that things have improved a lot. Most of the time, the game feels as direct, impactful and responsive as Diablo 3, which is king in this regard. Sometimes, there are lags, but nothing to worry about in the long run. Presentation Technically, Path of Exile is good. Most Textures are crisp, detailed and the animations are fluid and well made. Some of the later areas can even be breathtakingly beautiful. But subjectively, I personally don't like the artstyle of the game. It feels to generic, sometimes it even seems to clean, while the envoirements are too static for my taste. I am bored by the constant darkness and the dim lighting. But all of this is subjective and I cannot critize the game for my personal taste. Afaik, most people really like the look of the game.When it comes to sound & music, I found Path of Exile to be surprisingly good. Most sound effects are distinct and impactful, while the music plays along nicely, especially in the NPC-Hubs. Replayability & Content To sum it up: The content is massive. You have 7 characters, each can be leveled up to 100, which takes weeks of time to reach. You also can play every character several times with different builds and those builds will have unique playstyles. There are tons and tons of loot, skill-gems, materials and other drops to look for. The Path of Exile team is also very busy, when it comes to seasons: Every new season features a new mechanic, which gets implemented into the game. Most new mechanics, that have been implemented in a season, stay in the game to expand the things you encounter. Right now, the Game offers 10 story-acts, split into two halves, while the second half revisits a lot of the older maps, while also changing a lot and offering up new boss fights. Aside from the story you have a S*itload of stuff you can do, so don't worry about content.When it comes to the F2P-Part of this game, don't worry: It is fair: You don't have to pay for anything. You can play any part of the game, for as much as you want for free. The only thing you can pay for are cosmetics and some improvements to your stash, making collecting and sortings items easier for you. While I find the prices for the skins, pets and stash improvements to be quite steep, I applaud the developers for this system, which is so fair, that I spent money on their shop just to show gratitude. TL;DR PROSTight, responsive controls......giving a visceral and satisfying combat feelingMassive content with potentially hundreds of hours of fun to be hadIncredibly complexExcellent F2P-SystemCONSSUBJECTIVELY dreary visuals, while technically soundSteep learning curve for new playersHardcore can be frustrating, since damage can spike out of nowhere and kill you in an instant. Recommendation? If you like ARPGs and are willing to dive into a very complex game, you will have hundreds, if not thousands of hours of fun with this one  ",1
2602,Path of Exile,2018,"For all the people who are whining about the game not having an auction house, please stop. This is what makes the game different. It's not like you are just buying something for currency and instantly getting it, you actually have to interact with the traders. Now i know that this might cause some problems for people who have bad PCs, but trust me this is very healthy for the community. Today i wanted to buy an Atziri's disfavour for 5 exalted orbs, but i did not have the currency for it, and i kindly asked the guy to please not sell it, because i really need it but i dont have the currency yet, and you know what happened? He sold it to me for 4 exalted orbs! Now this may not sounds much, but having nice people like this helping you makes your day better. Also about the server issues..... PoE is free to play and Betrayal had double the players compared to last league's launch (which was really popular and it broke the records at that time), and they weren't expecting that many players. They also apologized for the issues and fixed it as soon as possible. PoE is all about trial and error, even if you have couple hundreds of hours and feel like you know everything, trust me you don't! Even if you feel like its all about the RNG, it really isn't , if you run blood aqueducts for 2 hours, you are garaunteed to atleast get about 10 chaos orbs.",1

2605,Path of Exile,2016,"I plan to write more reviews, but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoA 100% free to play game that has more depth, more content, and much to do than most games you would shell out money for. It's like Diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. Story- You are exiled and left in a continent or place called Wraeclast. You venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in Wraeclast.Gameplay- You select various classes: Maurauder (melee/tank), Duelist (Hybrid of melee/range), Ranger (Archer), Witch (Mage), Templar (Hybrid), and a Scion (unlock after 1st act). So there is a character for just about any play-style. Destroy the many hordes of creatures in Wraeclast to gain experience and level up. You get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. You get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. And PoE boasts a massive skill tree that I have ever seen in games. The skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. Online/Co-op- There is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. There are guilds to join. You can trade some of your gear with other players. There's also PvP, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. Cons- Minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. You think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. It can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. But it's a minor gripe.Conclusion: If you like Diablo games, give this a try. Game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. There's plenty to do. The game today is completely different from when it was first available. Most importantly, the game is FREE!! The only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. This was the first game I ever put over 100 hours into on Steam, and it was worth it.",1
2606,Path of Exile,2014,"I've been playing Path of Exile since its Beta release, and i have pretty much nothing but positive reviews for this game. Infact, this game is so geniusly built i would actually be proud to say this is what Diablo III Should have been. (Sorry Blizzard, comming from a huge Blizzard game supporter in my past) The customization and variations of this game are so vast beyond anyones wildest dreams, I absolutely love it. Your currency system is GENIUS as well, its exactly what a game like Diablo lacked. Gold became really useless in late Diablo 2 gameplay, even in D3. It was really sad. Your currency system designed here keeps every currency in demand. No matter how far into the game you are.Ontop of this overwhelmingly amazingly positive review, you keep releasing more and more things that will keep this game alive for years to come and that truely takes talent.Leagues- BrilliantMore Skill gems!!! WOW EVEN MORE CUSTOMIZATION TO YOUR TALENT TREE BUILDS!!!!Reward incentives.And yet again, if you could put anymore cherries ontop of this wonderful cake that you already have, the game is FREE! Yet again, your genius plan works. Microtransaction is the way of the future! You keep huge respect for your games F2P Scene but yet if a player wants to spend a little money to customize their Character, they can by choice.MY ONLY COMPLAINTS about this game  (Which is extremely hard to fix) is your rubber banding system. I dont know if it is because of lack of servers around the world or not, but it has adressed me some serious problems when playing Hardcore mode in your game. And i know that is disheartening to any gamer. My other complaint, which really isnt even a complaint, is this games graphics. Its not a deal breaker by any means, but  feel like it could use some improvement.All in all I would rate Path of Exile a 9/10 since you seem to keep improving this game further and further.  You have my highest respects, one of the best RPGs to date.",1
2607,Path of Exile,2017,Quite possibly the best free to play game out there.It definitely follows the core mechanics of Diablo but does them even better.Hours upon hours of fun with friends.. Highly recommend.,1
2608,Path of Exile,2018,"Really want to like this game the constant rubber band lag makes it unplayable. Attacks can be delayed by 30 seconds when lag builds up. To prevent hacking (I assume) the game needs to verify every attack/move creating massive delays with large mobs on the screen. The result rubber banding while trying to move or actions taking 20-30 seconds to get processed.Not a game breaker: no unique loot drops when playing in parties going to have to share.Tried playing this game long time ago, uninstall for same problem. Gave it a second chance to see if the problems have been fixed and going to uninstall again.______The actual game mechanics are great the network/server problems are horrible.",0
2609,Path of Exile,2018,"Basic Summary:- It's not a Mobile Game- The developers haven't done any shady things- Atmosphere and Gameplay feel genuinely reminiscent of Diablo II (Not a Clone, but a sequal feeling)- Decent Gameplay- Care and effort clearly put into developmentOverall a solid ARPG and significantly better than Diablo Immortal will be.",1
2610,Path of Exile,2016,"This game has led to alot of moments for me, alot of them being hilarious, whether that was me being a noob or not in the situation is a different story.  I still love playing this game for the fact that there is still a ton of stuff I have yet to try.  Some of my freinds have asked me advice and to be quite honest, even with 1000+ hours, I still feel like a major noob.  The biggest thing I mention is, try out the silliest thing you can think of, getting rid of tradtional thoughts about character steriotypes is important I feel.  I also love how with 1000 hours, the crafting system atleast for me has been always a touch out of my reach, for the challange leagues I mean.  Would deffinetly reccomend to arpg fans.Update:The game is headed in a new direction currently.  Mechanics are getting reworked, new systems are getting implemented, and theyre doing away with replaying the game 3 times over and adding one single playthrough.  I still reccomend the game, just thought I'd post an update that changes seem to be on the way, for better or worse.",1
2611,Path of Exile,2016,"What to say about Path of Exile? Is it just another silly action RPG with mindless grinding on the market? Well, the game has a lot to offer and I'm not, by any means, the best person to tell you everything about it, but, I can tell for sure, that I've experience enough to assure you that this is an amazing action RPG, with an immense variety of builds, items and gameplay styles, besides the complex item economy. The fact that you've no restrictions (in terms of classes / characters) to use items and skills, as well as skill tree paths, creates an enormous variety of builds, making every character an unique experience. The game has beautiful graphics, with an exceptional dark theme to it; blood and corpses are everywhere, and that really gives that gruesome ambientation and, on top of that, the soundtrack, background sounds and noises really adds to this macabre experience. Most people say that this is the true successor of Diablo 2, although I can't tell for sure if it's true or not, this game is, certainly, way better than the sequel that is Diablo 3 (even with the DLC Reaper of Souls), don't get me wrong, both games are great, but Path of Exile has way more to offer and innovation is what the game industry is looking for. How is Call of Duty even alive?The game is going through constant updates and there is content everywhere, always something new to explore, be it items, areas, story, skills, etc.. The development team is constantly active and shows a lot of interest in what the community has to say about the game, which is a huge plus.TL;DRÂ Astonishing gameplay, pretty graphics, amazing developers, complex economy and a huge variety in terms of builds. A game that I can't recommend enough for those who are seeking a new action RPG, give this game a try and you might be surprised -- don't be scared about the skill tree though.",1
2612,Path of Exile,2016,"Very good, but beware! This game is not n00b-friendly at all (things could do with a lot more explanation).In PoE, you play an Exile who just landed on the coast of Wraeclast. From there, you will fight your way across the continent and find what's behind the corruption of the land. To do this, you use skill gems that you can socket into your equipment, different kinds of orbs that enchant your stuff and spend points in a massive passive skill tree. The skill tree in this game provides very few skills, because the majority is available as skill gems (that you can swap in/out at a moment's notice).I didn't try to use the global chat (too noisy), so can't really tell if the online aspect is good or not.",1
2613,Path of Exile,2016,"So i see it's not enough for a review to say the game is good, when it clearly is. But i will ellaborate my thought.So this game is my day to day grinding simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music. Since i'm not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo has kinda outlived it's era and passed on, to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame.I'm not comparing this game to diablo in anyway, and thats why i think it's good, it is another game.It has a lot of interesting very well made lore, tons of spells attacks and different ways to defend yourself, using all kinds of gems, that can freely be socket in and out of it's colour matched socket in your armor or weapon.The game has a certain difficulty, it's not a beginner frendly game in itself, it has a good introduction to wreaclast. But it's the community that makes that part great, theres tons of guides and videos on how to play the game, i myself have watched the streamer and youtuber ziggyD to get a feeling for patches and new items.the above have been almost only positive. But Path of exile have some downsides, and not just two but a bunch.A few big to mention are:the constant unsteadyness in the server. You will never know when the server suddenly decides to spike out, and there have been period where the lag have been almost character destroying ;) But it seems to have gotten alot better.It's repetetive, like there are 4 acts with different areas and a tons of different maps. But it all boil down to running from one end to another killing all in your way with a little sidequesting and master missions.The rng, if you arn't used to not get your way or just have really bad luck and can't take it when you lose, then this game is probably not for you, since it's system, thought it is possible to find out what areas to grind for certain items, it's 50% chance, a big part of the game is skill based , but if don't get the items you need your not gonna get far and almost everytime, give up on the character to start a new and see if that goes better or if some better items will drop. ofcourse on counter to that, there is a market for trading, so if you got coin community got ware.7/10for being the best grinding game for listing to music :D Love",1
2614,Path of Exile,2018,"Path of exile has very beautiful graphics, I recommend this game to all those who like hack n slash, who love gothic universes and all the fans of Diablo 1/2.

2617,Path of Exile,2014,"PROS:- Spiritual successor of Diablo II (visuals/art style, atmosphere, UI, level design, and so on.)- Perfect free-to-play scheme with zero pay-to-win elements (real money can be used to purchase cosmetic items only.)- Unique and interesting skill tree.- LootsCONS:- Unfriendly for casuals (inevitable rerolls due to complicated and unforgiving min/max builds.)- Obnoxiously frequent desync/lag issues.- Production value.Final Remarks:All H&S and ARPG fans should take a look at Path of Exile.. RECOMMENDED .",1
2618,Path of Exile,2017,Quite a spectacular game all around! I come from a D2/D3 era and I find this game a lot more complex and vivid in detail among those games of its kind. This game has all my recommendations for everyone to play! Great Game!,1
2619,Path of Exile,2016,"Path of Exile might easily cause a bad first impression - the combat and movement at early levels feels slow and limited. But it gets better.The skill system here allows for a lot of creativity in combining different gems, and the passive skill tree is a nice addition to make leveling up more interesting than most current Action RPGs that don't have any sort of real customization.Combat at higher levels feels fluid and allow for many different playstyles, and the game can be quite challenging at times for those that like Hardcore or just dislike dying in general. The way it deal with ""seasons"" (called Leagues here) is nice, and the fact that Hardcore characters aren't instantly deleted on death, but instead transfered to the permanent softcore league, is an interesting change.Crafting might feel overly-complicated at first, but it's actually a pretty interesting system that allows you to have some fine control over your gear, instead of fully relying on random drops alone.Another strong point of Path of Exile is that it is truly free to play. The cash shop here is something that you'll only ever  spend money on if you wish to support the game.",1
2620,Path of Exile,2015,"Product received for freeafter 175 hours i can say honestly say this is a great game. many people say its better than diablo 3 while not quite as good as 2, and although i have never played those games i can say it is an amazing game. there are a lot of free to play games that are pay to win this one IS NOT ONE OF THEM. it has stuff you can purchas but all you can buy is some extra storage, storage for your guild, and skins. now lets give some pro's and consPro's:lots of contentfree DLC's. the DLC's are actualy just the updates that expand the game more and moretones of different builds you can playgood multi player. the guild system and party systems in my opinion are great and deffently let your friends play the game with you effectivlycon's:grindy. this may be seen as a con though i personly enjoy grinding for better gearcan give you the feel that enemys are OP if you do not quite know how it works though with a bit of messing around it feels balancedmultiplayer although it self is great shared loot is bad. if you have a friend who jumps in to take any and all drops you will not get any dropsya thats all i can think of. although there are about the same ammount of pro's and con's i can honestly say with some play time this game is one of the best there is. it is the best free to play game, and honestly my favoret games out there. a truely free to play game is amazing as there are not many out there that are not pay to win like this one is",1

2622,Path of Exile,2017,"Acts are tedious, especially acts 1-3. So boring having to go through that everytime a new league starts. Microtransactions are greatly overpriced. You will need to spend money on this game if you even think about doing end game content. This game is also filled with way too many bugs. You will definitely get disconnected from time to time and it will be due to their end, not yours. Your game will freeze during important moments and cause you to die. This makes hardcore pointless to play.

2623,Path of Exile,2016,"Path of Exile is an isometric game developed by Grinding Gear Games based around the gameplay made famous by the Diablo series.

Because the labyrinth is not fun. It does not matter how many times they shorten it, the lab will never be fun. It is a chore to do the trials and the lab. The only thing it adds to the game is each characters ascendancy, which can be added in any number of different ways. Such as replacing the new almost worthless pantheon system. Another negative aspect of Path, is trading. Path of Exile relies on a third party website in order to trade. Many have said, if this website were to go down for whatever reason, they would quit Path. The game offers absolutely nothing in terms of trading other than a cancerous trade chat akin to Diablo 2, where scams are the commonplace. This website is not supported in anyway by GGG, but every single person who trades uses it. It should also be said that GGG protects scammers, and when if you try to call the scammer out you will get banned for ""name and shame"".TL:DRAs it has been said a thousand times already, the true successor to Diablo 2. All the while not bringing in anything new except for better graphics, new skill system, and ""microtransactions"". edited after 3.0 update",0
2624,Path of Exile,2018,I really enjoy the game it is a close design set up to Diablo. The Problem is the imbalance to elemental resistance is insane I am playing as a elementalist running to point to where I am doing almost no damage even with switching between elements. Or even using gems to penetrate the resistance it feels like the game is geared to much toward warriors or summoners. It punishes you for playing the way you enjoy to where it takes the enjoyment away. I love a chalenge and a hard game but I don't enjoy a game that trolls certain classes.,0
2625,Path of Exile,2018,"Community is immediately toxic, and party support characters seem like an afterthought at best.Would need to get into the community to find a support role, and that does not sound even remotely inviting. Even free, I have no purpose for this game.It runs well, and is easy to get started in.Controls are good but lack polish. (Menus and sales interractions are a little clumsy compared to Diablo titles.)If you played diablo to be a grumpy pvp slumlord, then maybe check it out.If you want an RPG that you and your friends can 'care' more about party interactions, this is not it.",0
2626,Path of Exile,2014,"Worst FPS I've ever played. 10/10Edit: I noticed this review recieved a lot of attention for some reason. In all seriousness, Path of Exile is a fantastic ARPG with some of the best character custimization options in the entire gaming industry. With the removal of desync, I can proudly say this is easily the best ARPG on the market and given its extremely ethical business model and excellent game developers, there is no reason any fan of rpgs or arpgs alike shouldn't atleast give this game a try.",1
2627,Path of Exile,2017,"Pretty standard game of that genre.You can choose between the standard classes, the story is segmented in acts and there are leagues with new and (more or less) unique content every now and then. What i personally really liked about this game is that you get access to a small area called hideout that you can decorate as you want, whilst players within your friend list and members of your team and guild can visit it as long as you're online. You have access to the stash, vendors, dailies, pvp and the end game content in the hideout.Sure, the options of personalising your hideout are limited, especially since this is not a sims game, but it's still a nice feature.The (maybe) biggest downside of this game however are the microtransactions, the pricing in particular. Microtransactions doesn't have to be inherently bad and it's laudable the items in the store are solely cosmetic, with exception for the increase of stash tabs and guild member slots, but nothing that could change the performance of a character by any means. But pricings of around 40 bucks for an armour set, around 10 bucks for headgears or currently up to 80 bucks for a simple pet are more than just overpriced.Also, as far as i've noticed and from what i've heard from other players, this game seems to suffer from performance drops and disconnects from time to time.All in all, i would like to give this game a mostly neutral to slightly positive rating, despite all the negative points this game may (currently) have. It simply has not much outstanding to me, even though it was surely fun for a while. [Note: i've mostly played this game in the legacy league, version 2.6, so parts of this review may not necessarily be valid to future versions of this game]  ",1
2628,Path of Exile,2016,"Ive been playing this game since it was first conceived over 7 years ago. well over 2000 hours before steam, It is a beautiful game that blizzard wished they could have developed. Its got a splash of everything great, little issues and most of all the content updates are out of this world. I would glady pay 60$ for this game rather than D3, I want this game to have my babies. 11/10 would unplug granny for more support packs.",1
2629,Path of Exile,2013,"To be honest, I didnt expect much when I saw the first screenshots. ""Oho another cheap ARPG!"" I realised very quick that Path of Exile was closer to Diablo II (which is awesome) than Diablo III actually is.  And the skilltree, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this skilltree is mindblasting. You gotta focus what you do else you get lost :) This skilltree + the abillitys granted by gems were maybe the reason I met in my first PVP match a lightningbolt spamming warrior which was jumping with his big battle axe over the arena tearing me apart. And I was like, LOL that looked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but this is POE!!!!",1
2630,Path of Exile,2018,"Feels clunky, looks clunky. Has huge depth for hardcore min-max players but offers nothing for me that I cant get out of the other games in the genre. Cant argue on the price so go test it out yourself and see if its your cup of tea.",0
2861,Path of Exile,2018,"This game is pretty good. I've been playing Diablo since it came out, and Path of Exile just blew my mind at first. The ammount of costumization compared to Diablo is insane. True classic hardcore gameplay in which you can do whatever you want with your class of choice. Itemization and gem system are also insanely customizable. It's like a dream come true for someone that have been in a ""cage"" (Diablo 3) for some years. Huge amount of little mechanics that keeps your head busy for a long time while you're playing the story. Also at this point there's already much more story content: 10 Acts with incredibly varied storylines and distinct artstyle for each world region. I love Diablo but PoE is on a whole another level entirely. This is easily the new standard of modern ARPG. Now for the cons:- Huge letdown is that microtransactions are way too effin expensive, if you're outside US. They've simply converted their DLC store from US dollars to whatever currency it's used in your country, so if my currency is like 1:4 USD, I'm f-ed. A set of skin in this game is worth more than 1 month minimum wage salary here. I don't care about skins but other stuff are needed to play this game confortably, like stash tabs. I can't take this game seriously if I know I won't be able to keep my sanity in the long term. The game is good, but food and housing comes first.- Trade system is archaic, to say the least. I know they're trying to replicate Diablo 2 nostalgia here, but its a process that aged very poorly. The game absolutely need an in game full fledged market system. I'm glad there's any trade at all, but I often want to quit the game just because trading is so cumbersome. You have to pm people, hope that they're online and wait for replies that almost never come.",1

You will likely end up dropping $15-30 for quality of life features, but those are completely unnecessary before your first 50 hours of having fun.However, not only the playstyles of characters vary a lot, but the way enemies try to defeat you as well. The game progressively introduces concepts such as rogue exiles, enemies that use group skills, auras, shrines, ghosts haunting bosses, blood magic etc. that keep raising the difficulty while keeping it skill, and not gear-dependent.In the endgame, players often find themselves making dozens of actions/decisions per second, dodging different projectiles, spells and charging monsters, using flasks, teleporting, modifying auras, applying curses in order to stay alive. Not only there are a lot of things to do once the main storyline is complete (after about 20 hours for a new player, another 10 hours if you want to read the in-depth lore), but simply fighting diverse endgame bosses is an exhilarating challenge in itself.",1
2872,Path of Exile,2016,"Addicted. That is all I would say if I was trying to sum this up in a few words.This game is absolutely amazing, my mate messaged me on steam saying ""Yo man, I found this game, you should check it out, its an RPG with like mages and stuff"" Usually I don't take much interest to games like this, but boy am I glad I took a chance with this game.The first hour of gametime I was feeling a bit like ""eh, this game is alright, its free cant get any better than what this is""If I could go back in time, I would go back and slap myself and say it is one of the best games I will ever play. Then after a few hours, I got better gear, better stats, and the longer I played it, the more I loved it.So here I am, finished the game on Normal Difficulty, and just heading into Act II on Cruel Difficulty, and I am loving it even more, it is so satisfying when you get even better gear because its so rare to find something that is better than the last when you have awesome magic attributes on your gear.Overall: Awesome game, if you haven't downloaded it yet, played it yet, or you don't really find these sort of games entertaining, download it right now, I promise you, coming from a guy who loves FPS Games this is completely different and I love it to bits.I have 1 issue with the game but it is understandable why it is the way it is. And the issue is the price of the Microtransations, but since the game is free they gotta make some of that $$$ somehow :D",1
2873,Path of Exile,2016,"After having sunk more than 1000 hours into this game in the last three leagues, I feel it's time to write a short review.If you liked Diablo 2 and hated Diablo 3, not because of the lack of PvP, you're going to love Path of Exile.  The game is ♥♥♥♥ing HUGE with tons of challenges.  You will not be grinding the cow level or doing baal run after baal run for the best loot that the game has to offer.

2875,Path of Exile,2016,"10/10This is the diablo-like with the most depth and design complexity I've ever played. There's so much character development possibilities, the game is amazing at giving tools to create the most crazy and ambitious builds and to make it incredibly rewarding. From the gigantic passive tree, to the crazy combination of gems you can make or how certain unique items completely change how some skill works... It's so amazing at letting you be creative and come up with ways to grow your character! And then the world of wreaclast is just amazing to explore, lots of lore and a very grim and dark setting reminding of the best parts of diablo 1. The soundtrack is incredible as well.Hand down my favorite diablo like and one of my fave games of all time, and it's truly free (money only gives cosmetics and inventory management help). The few cons - you cant turn the camera, meaning its best to attack enemies from the south when you're a long range hero. -Self Founds will have a hard time progressing in the end game.- Act 2 is unfortunately pretty boring compared to the rest of the game.",1

2890,Path of Exile,2014,"My review for this game back in 2014 was extremely positive when it first came around. Now in 2018 I decided to re:review this messy messy game. Unfortunately POE has gotten worse with every release of new content. Kinda the opposite of what you would think would happen right. In the first year of the game being released it was very fun to play with excellent balance of difficulty, slightly complicated socket system but amazing when you finally digested it. Then...................they F'ked with it. Every time new content was released they would up the difficulty level and completely destroy builds that were very fun and effective but still challenging as you continued. Eventually it got to the point where there was no use in exploring any of the new content because it was all ""cow level"" one hit death stuff. Remember the secret cow level in Diablo 2? Pointlessly accessible early in the game but impossible to do until you've reached a super high level and have been through the game 3 times over. Absolutely pointless content because it is not ever even close to doable when you come across it.This game pretty much exclusively caters to hardcore super grind style players who enjoy statistic/stats minutiae hell. Despite its vast depth, Path of Exile just isn't fun to play if you are a casual gamer. Try Diablo 2/3 or Torchlight 2. All excellent choices with good balanced game challenge that doesn't get stupid hard unless you push it to end game levels. (which is how proper game mechanics should work)",0
2891,Path of Exile,2017,"Well, since I wrote my review they have added ridiculous amounts of garbage to the game. They definitely have brainstorming sessions for how to come up with new items and even categories of items to add to the game. this way they can sell you a new card tab, and an essence tab, etc.They have lost sight of what made the game good. It went from a game with the best loot to one of the worst. 99% of items that drop are now garbage. It is bad enough that they expect people to buy more and more tabs to deal with their hyper inflation of item types and categories, but they don't even care that we also have to sort all this junk.Do they realize that they are making the game tedious? Even if I was filthy rich, and I could buy 10,000 tabs, why would I want to sort that many items?!?! This utter disrespect for the time of their customers, just so they can make as much money as possible, has earned them this negative review.Strawberry fields forever... because: greed.original review several years ago: the true diablo 2, because it understood the best part of diablo 2: how to make the powerful armor/weapons feel distinct and their effectiveness and useability unique and not just different numerical values. amazing game, until you reach end game. then you start to see how the free to play model does actually influence gameplay design and how the player is expected to become a gambler and hoarder to continue enjoying the game (inventory space = $$). however, the game is free and the skill system gives you hundreds (thousands?) of hours of nerd or-ga-sm-ic (don't censor this volvo, because that makes it unintelligible) experimentation with new characters, so i must recommend it.",0
2892,Path of Exile,2015,"Thank you for erasing the build I have put, actually, too much thought into.  I will be reclaiming all 15 GB of space this game has taken up.  The aggravation this game has given me has finally broke the camel's back.  Goodbye.",0
2893,Path of Exile,2018,"Go big or go home.PoE is, at its core, all about RNG. RNG loot drops are the core game mechanic. As one person put it ""Fighting loot, finding monsters."" The game has plenty to recommend it: great graphics, inspiring sound & music, a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character builds is nearly endless, great customisation and the best MTX system I've yet seen in a game where 95% of all items that can be purchased with real money are purely cosmetic in nature. The other 5% are quality of life items that do not in any way make PoE pay to win. This is how all game companies should do microtransactions.My problem with PoE is that the nature of the RNG systems means that actually useful items are *incredibly* rare. The entire game economy appears to be designed with the 1% twitch broadcasters in mind who play thousands of hours of PoE & nothing else. That's fine, but it essentially locks an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty walls that can only be breached by spending huge amounts of time playing. If like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff, work, family etc then I would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere. My ~500 hours (at the time of writing) have been accumulated over the past 5 years.If you're willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibilities that PoE offers, and the deep meta game are very rewarding and for these players PoE is the best ARPG available. If however you have limited gaming time or play casually then don't bother, you're not the target audience for this game unfortunately.Would I recommend PoE? Yes, but only because I enjoy playing with my friends. This is not a game that I play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the best gear is frankly unbelievably boring.",1
2894,Path of Exile,2018,"Fun game occassionally. But the game is really really unbalanced. Some parts are just way too easy and all you have to do is spamming random keys, and then suddenly the next boss just oneshots you and you can't do anything about it.

[ex. A whirlwinding archer but is also Raiden from MK with chain lightnings]D3: You don't have choices other than cliches and you are the chosen one. PoE is free and has more players & replay value. D3 is still expensive with all the DLCs and have a casual or even shallow end-game.Looking for a well polished, hack n slash game : D3Looking for Diablo 2 on steroids : PoE.",1
2896,Path of Exile,2018,"Honestly, I love many parts about this game... but I can't overlook a couple things about it.  TLDR: Path of Exile does not value your time.  If you have a carreer, or family, or anything else in your life, PoE is not made for you.  You would have to spend thousands of hours to get to play all the way through the game, and that is horrendous in my opinion.  A game should be fun, challenging, and rewarding.  Forcing people to pull the lever on a slot machine is not real difficulty.  Their main goal is to keep the carrot danging in front of you, and you will never, ever, find the game you want.  It's all about the chase, and at the end you will have nothing to show for it.What I love:1) The customization is super deep and very enjoyable.2) There are lots of activities to grind and feel like you are making progressWhat I hate:1) You will have to trade.  Other players will do their best to rip you off.  It is a job to become knowledgable about the market so that you can properly price and trade items, but investing hours pouring over pages of item prices won't make you good at it.  Some people play this game for the ""economy"" and enjoy trading and becoming stupid wealthy... to them I say fine.  Enjoy flipping currency and buying out items to inflate prices.  I will go play SSF... except you will never find the items you need, and you can't craft endgame items for a targeted build.  So either learn to love poe.trade or play a different game.  Hint: play a different game.2) Crafting is so absurdly expensive that you should never try it.  It is deep, but you will blow every single currency item you have before you see the item of your dreams.  You may be able to accidently craft something other people could use, but then you have to find out what it's worth and trade it.  Or play SSF, and never see the great items you want to make your obscure builds work.3) Gating content behind RNG... So Breaches spawn randomly, and then they drop a random number of shards, and then when you finally get 100 (could take 15-50 breaches.. no joke sometimes they drop 2), the Breach boss has an RNG chance to drop a unique item.  They don't have to drop, which is suppperr frustrating.  Took me months to finall run a breach and Xoph dropped nothing.  Was crushing.  In SSF I can't just run it again...Another example is uber atziri.. I've never fought her.  I map fragments drop randomly, and there is no recepie to trade them up.  So you will be waiting for midnight fragments to randomly drop... then Atziri has a random chance to drop fragments for her more difficult version... and again you will never get the rare fragment you need.  Another example is Shaper.. I have never fought him because I can't get the maps to drop in order to fight him.  I have played over 1000 hours in SSF and still i'm missing some of the shaper fragments.  Sustaining tier 15's is impossible.  I can sustain 11-12's but past that it is random that if you get the maps you need.  The more maps you finish the LESS likely the map you need will drop.  Infuriating as all hell.  Never fought uber elder or even Red spawn elder... not because I can't kill it, but because I can't get the maps to drop to kill his guardians.Why are prophecies weighted by rarity?  You will get the same 10 prophecies that do nothing over and over again.  You will never see the ones that you find exciting.  Plagues of frogs and lost maps forever.  Smothering tendrils? ughSo Basicallllyy... It is a cluster of RNG on top of RNG.  It's a slot machine, and all the ""skill"" in the world won't help you.4) Party play sucks.  People just rip through maps in this game.. like literally a whole map (like 40 screen widths) in about 2 minutes, then rush through the next one.  The game is balanced around this and you have to go that fast to see profit.. there isn't a way to go slow in a dangerous map and see the same returns.  It's all about easy maps as fast as possible.  You will feel like people pulling you through the whole game.  This game has to be tuned down so that the pace is more reasonable, then they could retune the drops to also be more reasonable.Another problem with party play is the sheer number of sparkly things and circles and rings and projectiles.  It's is impossible to see what is going on.  Generally everything is dead the second you see it, but if it's not you wouldn't be able to tell.If you love this game, I could understand why, but don't pretend you love these parts of it.  These are fixable problems if there is the community will to have them fixed.  If you don't think over a thousand hours is a long time to play a game, I think you have an addiction.  I am an avid gamer, but there has to be bounderies on what is reasonable to expect your players to do in order to progress.   Hope they fix it",0

You have to go through everytime.- Too much unecessary loot (little bugs droping heavy armours!).- Countless of weapons which make no sense. (a common problem with diablo genre) Bottomline : Evil Blizzard's worst nightmare.Recommend : Play it now. ",1
2900,Path of Exile,2014,"I have completed most Endgame content as of 3.1. Including solo Shaper (a bunch of times) and solo uber Atziri (once), I've played on and off since closed beta. I have spent quite some money on this game.I gave this game a positive review back in 2014 and I have since then changed my mind. MicrotransactionsOkay, let's face it: the microtransactions are pay to win now (and they have always been pay to win). People who pay money get disproportionate storage space - especially for currency, maps, and essences. When you hit the lategame - your stash will clog up. Please don't deny this fact.Temp leaguesI like the idea of temp leagues (last a bunch of weeks, fresh economy, fresh start for everyone). They're great. You get challenges, you run around and complete them, some special gimmick is introduced as well - fun all around. You progress through the game, you get various gear, you go to weird and beautiful places. All good. However, this doesn't work well with the main issue I have with the game.The main issueThe developers have realised that variation is core to keeping this game fresh...... and the main component that does not get enough variation is your player character.The issue is that when you hit the late-game your character usually does one or two things to deal with combat. It usually runs some auras, an attack skill (maybe two?), and some movement skills. These setups are extremely hard to change as you need to revamp your passive skill tree - something which costs ingame currency. You are essentially encouraged to specialise into one particular thing and not do anything else on that character. Unplanned characters generally do not work in the lategame.I'm going to draw some comparisons to Warframe now (yes, I know, Warframe is blatantly pay to win).In Warframe you are encouraged to mix your playstyle up. You level up by using different kind of gear and characters. You are encouraged to build everything and try it. Getting a new character may at times take a while, but mostly - you can generally get a new character ready to play in one hour of playtime + 3 days of wait if you're in the lategame. A game for the patient, but you don't need a plan to start playing with the character. You just use it and then later on you can optimize. There's obviously some characters that are better than others, but generally speaking, things are open to change and you can experiment without too much cost. You can re-use weapons and components (mods) across characters as well.Contrast this to Path of Exile: you get one skill tree per character, if you want another one you first need to hit the lategame with a character (takes maybe.. 8 hours or so?), followed by many hours spent getting gear for it, getting through the lategame and that gives you one new setup that you can use.If you want to change things up you have to spend a lot of time getting another character essentially, spend a bunch of currency on orbs of regret to respec an existing character, or use Path of Building and try to imagine what it would be like. Also, there's no practical re-use between characters as each item has to be physically moved to that character.My general suggestion would be to at least allow characters to change their skill tree and ascendancy at any given time or have several passive tree setups that you can swap between while in a town (say 3-5 different trees). Before you say ""I'm so hardcore I don't need additional trees or any reallocation like that because I plan ahead!"" - is it worth it though? Consider that newbies will get confused by the passive tree and make the wrong decisions at some point - which means that they will possibly quit the game forever when they hit the lategame as their characters are in a worthless state. It ultimately harms the game and makes it less fun for most people. Heck, why not have a separate league where reallocation is allowed? I would probably start playing the game again if that was introduced.(edit: newbies hitting the lategame and then just quitting due to their characters being bad does happen, I've spoken to some)ConclusionWhile I would highly recommend trying the game to see what a F2P diablo-like looks like, the core issue of a lack of variation in the character itself kills it for me in the long run. Find a build on the forums that people say are good and use that if you want to play it.",0
2901,Path of Exile,2015,"Only thing u need to do for passive points is to get the health notes in that stupid tree, even keep the same in the mid-late game if u want to go Chaos Inoculation, only less than 20% passive points are what you can ""really"" choose, which stated that 80% of level up means nothing to you    and they just keep make it worse, I started to play the game when u need at least 3.5k hp for safe farming, now they just made u need 5k hp to save u from 1 shot!!!    lets not even talking about the lag, every time I lag I lost 30% exp, its something I cant even do about, I dont understand how this game could be so much more lag than LOL or SC II     Developers may feel that dying is not frustrate enough for players which do get a death count on the character, that they have to let player lose 30% exp to MOCKING them, no matter if they got bad luck for MF or laggy, I am playing a game for fun not a time drill !!    and the worst part is THE INTERNET MAKES NO DIFFERENT FOR THIS GAME!!!! most people just play by themselves and this game require 100% internet connection of the whole time!! what is the point? what was I flying all around the map for?   Gem linking system is the most good part of the game but the skills balance is just bad, few skills are clearly better than others, they did a lot change but some time just make it worse, wasted so much potential    I dont mind pay for the game but I mind for those over priced meaningless stuff in the store, nothing really improve my game experience   I had such hope for this game that make me played 300 hrs more but still couldn't see even the slight chance of change coming",0
2902,Path of Exile,2014,"Path of exile is by far the most riveting and intriguing game I have ever played.  Through the variations of character selection and weapon/armor  types it is just absolutely superior to all other games.  Through my career of working for Riot games I have earned the opportunity to play and help design many variations of video games.  I truly believe that no other game compares to this one.  Path of exile is a game that you will not soon forget and will not easily get bored of. Path of exile leads you to many hours of action packed game play.  From the start of the game you are immediately thrown into action as you wash up on the shore and you find that everyone is dead around and you are surrounded by flesh eating zombies as well as many other creatures.  You have to fight your way through the unforgiving world as you collect new weapons, armor, stones, wands, and many other achievable items.  I believe that this is the best action RPG I have ever played.",1
2903,Path of Exile,2015,These skill trees are out of control! Teh game is your pretty standard diablo looking game HOWEVER this is still amazig. Its dark setting really helps as well. There are 6 characters all with massive skill strees that allow you to build them a unique way to your playstyle as well.As for the micro transactions from what i can tell it's all comsetic stuff! No pay to win here folks!,1
2904,Path of Exile,2016,"Path of Exile is probably one of the best free to play games I've played. The customization of attacks is massive and it was one of the first games that made me roll multiple characters to try different things. Well worth trying out,",1
2905,Path of Exile,2018,"Played and loved this game long before it came to Steam and had many Acts added to it.Anyways, I highly recommend it to ARPG fans.My Isometric ARPG rankings:1. Torchlight 22. Path of Exile3. Diablo 24. Titan Quest5. Diablo 3",1
2906,Path of Exile,2018,"Whenever I decide to go back to Path of Exile, I remember the good old days when I didn't have any income whatsoever, but was just so excited by the thought of playing those few games I could! Path of Exile was one of those games. If my memory serves me correctly, I have upwards of 200 hours logged in this ARPG.  Each update added a new layer to the complexity of the game. For a new player, the complexity was something that initially pushed me away. Just take a moment to look up ""Path of Exile Passive Tree"" and you will get a good idea of what I mean. It is (or was) easy to make a character that had such poorly allocated stats that it was very difficult to progress. Perhaps that is (or was) a part of its charm. You have to figure out what skill gems, equipment, support gems, passive tree configurations, and (if you were so lucky as to get a relevant one) unique items would serve you best. Finally claiming success in beating all of the acts for the first time brought me a feeling that I would claim rivals beating a Dark Souls game for the first time. I have not caught up with the community, but in my experience, it can be quite toxic. I recommend trying it out with personal friends or alone, rather than a random party. That being said, it is absolutely viable to play on ones own, and that is was I did before I figured out how to properly navigate the initially confusing UI. Definitely need an open mind when trying this one out.",1
2907,Path of Exile,2013,"It's a hardcore diablo clone. Deeper customization (complex passive skill tree, materia-like active skill gems, good itemization), steeper learning curve, commodity oriented economy, regular fresh leagues, special events, end game random maps (similar to Torchlight). Oh, and it's ""ethically free to play"" (pay for convenience rather than ""pay to win"").",1
2908,Path of Exile,2016,"I could have studied for my History Exam.But it was more interesting uncovering the archeological findings of the wood carvings made by a woman who documented  the horrors of the Black Storm in the Northern Ranges, watching her neighbors transform and change into grotesque and insane figures that fall one by one to the plague and fall victims to the cruel acts of necromancy. Her husband long left to find a cure, her uncle's head shuttered by Bravalo's hammer, god damn it Bravalo. Coni welcomed the insane into the house because her nightmares told her to, resulting in her family members and friends dying and rising again to feed on human flesh, including her daughters.Conclusion: Fantasy lore is way more interesting than how my country got founded.If I fail it was still worth it.",1
2909,Path of Exile,2014,"Really fun game! Gorgeous levels, fun skills (and even more fun skill tree, if you happen to like Final Fantasy 10), and totally free. You can support the game with microtransactions, which you may really be compelled to do after realizing this game's replayability.There are points in the game where you're going to have to rush into rooms full of like 30 glowing, pumped up monsters cosplaying as rich TF2 players to take away their buffs which are hiding SOMEWHERE and that is totally terrifying, but fun, and even more fun if you're playing with multiple people so you can portal right back. One of the levels straight up made me miserable that I couldn't call in a tactical air strike and just wipe it out, though.",1

Customization is better than ever now that we have Ascendancy classes (huge subclasses bonuses) and the end game is about to get an overhaul with the next Atlas of Worlds expantion.Still a ""Must Try"" title.Also, don't lose hope/interest if you don't defeat the almighty Hillock, Brutus and/or Merveil ;)Just keep trying and you will find a great game that will make your wife leave you.(Steam told me to update my review for a medal so I did)",1

""not saying that story is bad ,but will say that it didn't realy drag me in that much too feel amazed not to mention that i didn't realy dig that much through dialog from characters.-Graphics:The game as i said looks Gothic style too me ... but even thought it looks like that what makes me a bit annoyed is how your character feels like♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to design (no matter how much you try you will still look almost like a Hobo if you don't start buying some cosmetics or earn them through events).-Gameplay:PoE did great when it comes to gameplay and how its abilitys works THERES SO MUCH when it comes to making your build its soo fun Example: You found a fireball and now you want it to be even more good ... OK just slap multi shot and slap more stuff and combine gems and all that and you get some EPIC cluster ♥♥♥♥ ability that is so satisfying that your PC freezes.Than we got a MASSIVE skill tree ... realy massive i ain't kidding.What i don't enjoy about Path of exile doe is that your own build if you are not experienced with the game will 75% SUCK, the close you are to the end the more and more you see your build failing.Now its not always gonna be like that but still the game allows you to build anything , But if you wanna reach to the end you will probably have to stick too few common things even though you don't want to. ",1
2914,Path of Exile,2015,First it was a Diablo II on steroids (at least the feel of it). After a few years the game is in the category of its own. My first advice to new players - do not fear the passives tree :),1
2915,Path of Exile,2015,"Decent game that can be fun at times and be a good way to kill some time. Stays interesting as the game is frequently updated and their are many possible builds along with many skill points, though most of them being passive is very good and allows many playthroughs of the game. Very similar to Diablo 2 and 3, can rival both of them which is amazing and suprising due to Path of Exile being a free to play. I recommend this game and think it is good, apart from sometimes it can be boring and dull as some of the levels can get confusing and feel like a massive maze, this can add to the game at times aswell though, but some of the game's other features make up for this.",1

2917,Path of Exile,2014,"Simply put, this is what Diablo 3 should of been. And as a free to play game with the ability to pay money for cosmetic items this is a great game with many hours of fun to be had.I myself purchased some in game cosmetic items and a pet to support the developers in thanks for this fantastic title.(Game is more fun when playing with friends)",1
2918,Path of Exile,2013,"Very good hack and slash game. My only issue would be the server lag and sometimes rubberbanding but it comes with the nature of being an online game, but otherwise it is easy to lose hours upon hours in this game.",1
2919,Path of Exile,2015,"The only aRPG to rule them all. Can be a fairly hard learning curve. When you first start this game you either hate it or love it. It all really depends what kind of person you are. Your first character will practically ALWAYS fail, and 2 things can happen. You either get overwhelmed and can't get yourself to try again, or you can accept what happened and start up another character.(Perhaps the same build tweaked or another one entirely) For strategists and rpg enthuisests this game is  gold, over 1100 passive skill points to choose from with 7 different classes on the same tree. Meaning that there is no ""right class"" or ""right build"".(although some builds can be much easier/harder then others). A very unique skill system with an equally unique crafting system only makes characters more diverse with every player. If your skeptical, why not go ahead and try it, it's free and has no Pay2Win BS being shoved down your throat. If you love the game then you can buy microtransactions for cosmetic items, but isn't necassary at all. :)",1

2921,Path of Exile,2015,"Pros:- There is enough customization within the skill tree to let your imagination run wild and create a build that can be as fun and interactive as you want it to be.- Constantly being updated and improved by the Grinding Gear Games team. I started playing during the beta and since then they have added many features including; Act 4, Lockstep, Dominus, Hideouts, and many skill gems and unique items.Cons:- The trade system needs to be looked at in the near future, I should not have to go to a third party site, and look through the listings people submitted using another third party application, either work in some sort of player market or auction house system and let people trade items without alt tabbing out of the game to do so.- Diablo 3 looks and plays a lot more fluidly then PoE, if i drop a few packets in Path of Exile my client will freeze up for a few frames and then play catch up and the game will play in fast forward to catch up to where I should be. This is one reason I will never play on the Hardcore leagues.Conclusion:All in all I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoyed Diablo 2 and is seeking a little extra something after playing Diablo 3.",1
2922,Path of Exile,2015,"Everything Diablo 3 should have been and MUCH MUCH MORE!Seriously if you like ARPG's or Diablo I'd recommend giving this a try, just look up some ZiggyD starter guides because this game can be intensely overwhelming at the start with the skill tree.Been playing since Beta and I love it, GGG knows how to please their players.",1
2923,Path of Exile,2016,"Very fun, unique take on a RPG. Basically, where games like Diablo and Torchlight have you level up skills through a skill tree, and add stats through gems/socketables, Path of Exile does the opposite. You add stats through a HUGE stat-tree, and add skills to your class through socketable items. Really cool, great atmosphere and lots of replay potential.Did I mention it's free?",1
2924,Path of Exile,2014,"Great game. I been playing it since Beta and enjoyed it a lot. For a free to play game, this game offers just too much. No need to spend a penny. :)If you are bored, got nothing to play, but want to experiment with some game, you must give this game a try. Tons of action. Tons of fun.",1
2925,Path of Exile,2016,"You will play this game for 1000s of hours. Your first character will be garbage. Your second character will be garbage. You will farm.

2929,War Thunder,2018,"Oh joy, War Thunder. There's so much that can be said about this game and almost none of it good. Just gonna skip the pleasantries and wit for this one because honestly, it's not worth the effort.Let's start off with the matchmaking system. It's broken. Period. War Thunder's matchmaking system is based off of a vehicles' Battle Rating (BR), which is normally supposed to match you up with vehicles no higher or lower than 1 - 1.5 from your highest BR with preference to your specific BR, except it doesn't. I can't count how many matches I've been in where my max vehicle BR is 5.7 and I end up getting matched with 7.7's. It wouldn't be such a noteworthy issue if it was a new system, but it's been like this for years. How is a P-51 supposed to cope with 50's era jets and radar guided Anti-Aircraft vehicles? How is it fair for WWII tanks with primitive ammo to go up against Cold-War era tanks with advanceed fin stabilized or SABOT rounds that have zero trajectory drop?Thus brings me to key issue #2. There's no clear-cut line separating WWII aircraft from Cold-War aircraft. If your BR is sufficient enough, you risk the matchmaking system putting your Me-262 against F-86 Sabres, MiG-17's, Hunters, etc. and your Maus up agains T-64's, AMX-30's, and on the off chance M1 Abrams'. There's literally zero balance here, WWII armor has no chance against the advanced ammunition of late-game vehicles and WWII jet fighters will have circles danced around them by late-game jets. Most WWII vehicles end up getting sniped from across the map not long after the game has started and well before they get the enemy in weapons range. It's utterly abhorrant how long this has been allowed to go on,Speaking of getting sniped, issue #3 on my list has to do with ballistics. The German Tiger I has a body that is essentially a rectangle with no armor sloping to deflect incoming shots. The 1 foot tall plate (by my eyeballing it) protecting the front of the tank sits at a 100 degree angle from the bottom plate it's welded to with a thickness of 10.2cm. The American M4A3E2 (76) W has a  2 - 3 foot high frontal plate (again, eyeballing it) with a thickness of 3.81 cm but sits at a 137 degree angle. The APCR shell of the M4 can penetrate an armor plate of 12.4cm at 1000m distance. How is it that the M4 cannot penetrate that 10.2cm plate in a face-to-face confrontation at only a hundred meters away? How can that same Tiger I not penetrate the M4's armor at the same distance? How is it that the 10.5cm gun of a Tiger II 10.5 can't penetrate the armor of a T-54 with armor-piercing rounds?  How can a Ferdinand's shell explode on the ground yet still have the shrapnel penetrate an M4A3E2, ricochet off the motor and kill *all* the crew? Answer: Gaijin doesn't care. Almost every single patch they put out to ""balance"" something breaks the entire system. One group of tanks always ends up incredibly hard to kill (as of this draft it's the Sherman Jumbo series) or destroys other tanks far too easy. The same goes for aircraft. Right now the Bf-109 series can out-turn an A6M Zero in Simulator Battles. Excuse me?! On what planet is a Bf-109 F-2 more manoeverable than an A6M2? It's a total mess, and it's a problem Gaijin simply doesn't seem to care enough to fix; again going on for *years*.Pay-to-win honestly doesn't exist.Are the Gaijin fanboys gone? Alright.It's totally pay-to-win. You can buy currency (Golden Eagles) for in-game content and services. One such service is the ability to apply convertible research points (which you earn by the truck-load) to whatever vehicles you choose, effectively skipping years of dedicated gameplay and blasting through the tech tree. I checked this feature out to see if there was some sort of limit as to how much/how far you can research. There isn't one. I blasted my way from the American tier I P-36 and PBY straight to the tier 5 F-86-A5 and the B-57B. At the time, those were the end-game planes for the US (B-57B is still the last American jet bomber as of this draft). People have worked for literal years to achieve what I did in just 5 minutes. The only thing that'd stop players from abusing this like crazy is the pricetag for Eagles; $115 CDN for the maximum amount. Eagles can also purchase a limited-time 'premium' membership for up to a year which pretty much doubles your rewards for every game. This point isn't so dramatic since every MMO seems to do this now, but it further cements the ball in P2W's court. Eagles can also be used to purchase 'Premium"" vehicles with a permenant reward boost, fortunately most aren't very good for very long.And my f-ing God is this a massive grind fest! It will literally take you 12 hours a day for about a year of non-stop grinding to reach the first tier of jet aircraft, moreso for tanks. It's beyond stupid. Grinding is a chore, people don't play games to do chores. Why are we expected to play the game for years before we get the results we want? Answer: It incentivizes us to throw our money at Gaijin for a shortcut. Layman's terms: Gaijin is pushing us to spend money on their game by making it grindy AF.The maps can be very annoying as well, especially when it spawns at night. Most are asymemstical, which gives one team a distinct advantage over the other, usually by giving them easier access to objectives, choke points to force the other team through, more cover, higher ground, etc. As mentioned before maps have time of day settings, which means there's a chance of having a night fight, where you can barely see the landscape 3 meters away, let alone an enemy player. Which brings up a glaring exploit: graphics. I understand Gaijin's desire for everyone regardless of whether or not they have a decent gaming PC to enjoy their game, but when someone can simply lower the terrain graphics to their lowest setting to cheat and literally render all distant bushes invisible so they can see me wherever I am, there's a major issue, one that probably cannot/ will not be solved.Honestly, I really could go on with all the problems in War Thunder and in continued honesty, there's not a whole lot good about it. The module damage/crew knockout system was a good concept but grew frustrating (how many f-ing times do we need to get killed by ""pilot knocked out""?!), there's a decent selection of not-very-balanced war machines with more being added every 4 - 6 months, custom battles can be fun with friends, and it's good if you need to kill time or get yourself frustrated for whatever reason. Beyond that, those are the good things I can remember about the game off the top of my head. Since this review is getting rather long and I doubt people are actually going to read the whole bloody thing, I'm cutting it off here.Did I miss anything?

But balant ignorance in terms of community management and the monetization politics destroy everything good about this game. Players are viewed as walking wallets and their satisfaction means nothing, because a lot of purchasable content exists just to make people avoid suffering. And premium subscription changes almost nothing, you must pay constantly and for every vehicle you are playing. Otherwise be ready that in 80% battles you participate in, you have a disadvantage.",0
2931,War Thunder,2018,"Devs more interested in money than the players enjoying the game, devs who actively mock players and ignore any feedback about a flawed ingame mechanic, devs who have the capacity to ruin a great game, that’s what you will get",0
2932,War Thunder,2018,"As someone who has played this game for not very long it became easy to see that this game is a cash grab, they seek to lure you in but the grind is meant to frustrate you so you purchase things. If you want this game summed up think of it like this, THIS GAME IS NOT FREE, THE GAME IS A PAYED SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR IT TO BE FUN.",0
2933,War Thunder,2018,"I wish there was a 'maybe' option for recommendation. War Thunder as a functional game has it's quirks, but is just fine and stands alone in what it delivers.However, it's management and documentation appear to have little to no thought put towards them at all. I feel sorry for the developers at Gaijin, because it's obvious they are working their fingers to the bone to add new items and fix multiple standing issues, but the part of the organization responsible for public interface usually boils all that work down to:Client stability has been improved.That is the message you get regardless of how many silent changes are made to major game mechanics, such as the flip-flopping of the (absolutely infuriating) ability to crash your bonus aircraft into ground vehicles in ground force arcade battle mode, and recieve a kill.Major issues;1 - major game functions and operation have gone completely undocumented. To determine how a given mechanic is supposed to work, you can check the warthunder site or wiki; if you don't immediately find an article you may as well give up because the only data you're going to find is speculative/anecdotal on the WT forum or reddit.2 - The game is too matured for new users to truly become established. Players gonna play, and some have been playing for three years straight and are practiced to seemingly superhuman levels of performance. And, as soon as you research a tier II or battle rating 3.0 (unsure which, not well documented), you're going to play these people. Prepare to die, unless you find a squadron to hook up with and guide you along.3 - Weird things happen, and Gaijin really doesn't seem to care. This is perhaps because some of the weirdness isn't so weird... it may be intentional. Gaijin is a Russian company with a largely Russian staff, and I can't fault them for having some national pride. I can fault them deeply for putting/leaving in place a series of metrics for shell penetration at angle, who's curves have curious bends in them (i.e. in the 'more likely to ricochet') right around the values where you'd find the most common angles of post-war Russian tank armor. They seem to take calculated risks in 'balancing' non-Russian vehicles by nerfing some component, but only so much that those playing the vehicles don't rise up in revolt since the game touts it's ""realism"". I have a feeling there are contingents on Gaijin's staff that fight over balancing versus realism, since the game seems to wobble drunkenly between the two states constantly. Bringing balance issues to Gaijin's attention is a fools errand unless you have copies of original texts and about 8 months to burn waiting for someone to actually take up your case, and be prepared to be told no, even in case of well-documented egregious errors in vehicle performance. Why? Because it doesn't fit whatever plan they have, or they simply can't be bothered.4 - near total lack of public communications over anything that's not new and revenue-generating. See ""Client stability has been improved"". If they'd spend a little more time on player stability....5 - massive hubris, everywhere you look. Be it a developer in a video quipping ""Everyone loves killing tankers, right?"", which was said very soon after the reintroduction of ""lawn darting"" play into ground arcade mode, to the moderators on the WT forums who are just doing their job but operate with a set of rules that always seem to end in ""send player to Gulag"", when the real problem with the forums is that players are so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at being ignored and uninformed that they're becoming toxic. I know, I are one. Said the sarcasm, got the warning. The biggest current issue under #5 is server performance.. probably. A great number of players report triple-digit pings and packet loss (the game shows you during play, bottom left corner). Packet loss is disastrous for WT because it's a server-side calculation engine; it's impossible to 'hack' most things, but if the server doesn't get your fire command, comrade, then you didn't fire. Except to you, you did. And the tank will register a reload period and loss of 1 shell, which doesn't matter much because you're usually dead by the point you'd notice. Anyhow, great swaths of people complain about this, but because they haven't gone through the exact steps... ignored. Pointing this out will get you banned, comrade. So it seems that the largest response you get from either the staff at Gaijin or the forum moderators is:""We don't believe you."" followed by thread lock. You know what? As I've been correlating issues here I've been getting angrier and angrier. The WT positives: Game looks great, game control is fine, fairly immersive. True free2play.Negatives: you're going to be abused on the playing field, badly. Problem? Gaijin don't give a damn. New functions come online without a lot of consideration for potential problems. Serious lack of PR comms for patches or other issues. General lackadaisical handling of anything that isn't a new mode or model. F2P play can accomplish everything paid play can with little exception (premium vehicles, etc), but expect every little advancement to take days, weeks, or months of crunching along in underperforming vehicles against players and squads that have been zapping newbs like you for half a decade. If you're a bad loser, STAY AWAY.  If you're a good loser... the game may make you a bad loser. If you're a winner, well, prepare to pay up or take so long to get anywhere that you go a little crazy anyways. Hey! You know what? The above review has convinced me to click ""NO"" on recommendation. I will, however, keep crunching along myself, because I'm masochistic like that. Don't get started in this game if you haven't already, it's like heroin... it'll sneak in and wrap itself around your soul, start it fermenting like a potato for vodka, and leave you drizzled all over a now-yellowed snowbank outside your prison camp in Siberia.",0
2934,War Thunder,2018,"The game is not bad, the grind is. But this is ok since the game is free, right?Well there are some things the Community would like to talk about. 1.

The grind on higher tiersAs others have said in their reviews you can still have fun with this game, especially at lower tiers.Napalmratte talks about some of this in his video: https://youtu.be/fze8l4fhn4c ",0
2935,War Thunder,2018,"360 Hours on steam, and thousands on the stand-alone client.  Back before there were tanks, the grind to unlock vehicles was reasonable.  The game felt progressive, like you could still manage to unlock later tiers such as III and IV without going premium, crew mattered, fleshing out different planes was engaging and fun.  One of these patches in the last year or two has brought the grind to an absolutely unbearable crawl.  This game has always been about grind, but there is a balance between grind and progress, which the devs have messed up.  When you strip away the progress/reward mechanic that people endeavor for in gaming, you're not creating an environment of entertainment anymore, you're wasting their time.  And this should be carefully considered; how many thousands of hours are you willing to -waste-....  I tried Premium for a few days just so I could dump all my RP into unlocking the Tiger, never ended up unlocking it, and the level of progression now with a Premium account, was the same as we had playing this back in 2012 F2P... So, in conclusion there's really no point in playing, and it's not that progression has been put behind a paywall, 'hey support the devs, they need money to develop!' guys, it's been put behind a paywall and neutered to such an extent that you will literally grow old before accomplishing much of anything beyond TII unless you pay for it... Don't waste your time or money, these are the kinds of models that ruin gaming.. Make the game, sell the whole thing, (not cut up into a million DLC) and prosper as digital artists if your game is solid.",0
2936,War Thunder,2018,"Repair costs are way too expensive, for exemple, you win a game and earn 20 000 SL, but you died two times so there is around 12 000 in repair costs, so at the end, you only get 8 000 SL, and it's worst when you loose.Also the FPE and Parts that are essential need to be free. I play this game since 2014 and they are right now doing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t not listening to the community. I hope they'll solve it soon, but right now, I'm really disapointed.",0
2937,War Thunder,2018,"I love this game to death. It's an amazing game. But Gaijin has pushed the limit on their playerbase. Just google the ""Free Abrams"" debacle. Their forum mods are at times obnoxious, and they are using shady and flagrantly obvious means to squeeze money out of people. I understand it is free to play, and they need to make money off of that. I respect that. However, they also have done a terrible job of communicating with the playerbase, and it has gotten to the point where it's frankly insulting. The in game economy is not set up properly. You can lose money even after getting multiple kills and completing objectives if you die. Balance is a constant issue, particularly in air realistic battles. It has now become obvious in the extreme they are now intentionally releasing unbalanced, but shiny new content which nets them the largest amount of money while managing to ignore (and in some cases offend) the concerns of their dedicated players. The grind is insane and takes an unbelievable amount of time and effort to unlock and make the upper tier vehicles survivable at all in combat. It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have a life outside of this game. I want to be able to at least progress in a manner that doesn't take literal months. I have played this game for years, but with all the other aforementioned issues, it is starting to lose its appeal to me.It is at this point obvious to me that the management of the company has probably sat around a table discussing this issue and probably quite literally laughed with each other, because they know people will still keep giving them money.",0
2938,War Thunder,2018,"This game used to be fantastic, but sadly as time went and each patch was released it became more and more about money and pandering than much historical accuracy and player enjoyment. To put this perspective for any new or current players Gaijin have become even greeder than Wargaming creaters World of tanks, and that is saying alot as they have a certain reuptation. Every patch adds new vehicles and planes to play as however, most if not all are overpriced premiums, lets not even start on how the screw the player base with its almost pay to grind method, where without a premium in your line up or a premium account you will struggle to make any credits plus the pittiful amount of exp gained each battle compared to the requirements for modules and new vehicles.And sadly they recently have bitten off more than they can chew as they now have planes, tanks and ships as it now shows in the new content as alot of recent planes and equipment added are just easy rehashs of old planes or tanks already in the game.Honestly, give this game a miss all my 1.5k hours were played back during the golden age of the game, before the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Br system and questionable design choices.",0
2939,War Thunder,2016,"Really tried to like it but has technical issues, at least on my pc AMD/Win10.Is not a MMO, is an online multiplayer tank/airplane capture the flag war game. You have a limited number of respawns in the same match, some maps has air&tanks units. I didn't found a proper way to organize battles, for people who does not have teamspeak is a free for all.It runs smooth (when it does not freeze), nice models and sounds.For a free game is ok.",0
2940,War Thunder,2015,"Last patch put the last nail in the coffin.Quantitative Restrictions not working still all high tier Planes/Tanks downranked have fun in lalalandJets vs Props, 60s tanks vs 40s tanks if you are searching for any kind of simulation or a game to have fun this is not it.",0
2941,War Thunder,2015,The game was great in the beginning with a new concept and all. Then they decided to change key aspects about the game. The game has lost its sparkle and is quickly going down hill. The Russian players dictate everything that happens with this game.The forums are a complete cesspool of terrible moderation. Gaijin might have the worst moderation team in the history of online games. It's absolutely amazing how they treat their customers.,0
2942,War Thunder,2015,"Every patch seems to make this game worse, they still have broken matchmaking after 3 years and they almost never fix anything.Community interaction is horrible and the dev team seems to be entirely discontected and isolated from the playerbase.Don't get invested TBH, it's disappointing.",0
2943,War Thunder,2016,"I cannot reccomend this game.I originally wrote this review in a bit more of a positive light, and I honestly wish feedback was excepted on the official forums. But, unfortanutely, this game lacks any form of dev support or care whatsoever.For starters, just reading the update posts by Gaijin made me want to delete this game and send it back to the bomb-crater it came from. Literally every other sentence was praising Russian historical documentation and how Russian books were the source of most of the information. And, honestly, I didn't care about that.What kills this game for me isn't that it's a Pay-To-Win game, it's a Free game that's Pay-To-Play. I was just fine in Tier 1 on my very first day, and I really looked forward to a grind and working up to my next tier of tank. I now regret sticking around that long.Ontop of that, matchmaking is the definition of team-stacking, with high-tier vehicles being placed specifically in one team, especially with things like Churchills. While my team cowers in fear, the enemy rolls over us in tanks a tier or even two higher than ALL of us.I wish this game was more open, and better. But, the devs of this game have destroyed it entirely. The match-making is despicable, the Pay-To-Win mechanic is absolutely disgusting, and the overall game would have been better off without both.",0
2944,War Thunder,2016,"War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.",0
2945,War Thunder,2016,"This could be a great game for people who love ww2 simulators like me, but it isnt even the pay to win that gets me, it is the play Russia to win. It is impossible to get fair matches due to the bias towards Russia in balance. I highly reccomend NOT playing this biased pay to win game.",0
2946,War Thunder,2016,"Welcome to War Thunder, the game where B-17s can get shoot down by a Russian Biplane, let's get started.Things I like:- Realistic flying mechanic- Damage modules-Both planes and tanksAnd that's it.Now, let's get to the things I hate.- Balance -> This game is not balanced at all, there are 5 nations to join: USA, UK, Germany, Japan and Russia, now, the real problem (seen from a USA main) is that every nation exept for USA and maybe UK is overpowered, especially Russia.It might be me, but I think there's a problem with the fact that a russian tier 1 plane can completly obliterate a tier 4 US bomber.- Teammates -> Altough there are some good teammates who like to actually play as a team, the majority of the players wanna just get points, they won't communicate, they will """"steal"""" your """"kills"""" and they will bomb the objective you chose to bomb. Not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds ))))- Bombers -> As a US Bombers main, I realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially B-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the B-17 is probably one of the weakest. And it's kinda strange, since in real life, the B-17 was one of the best bombers.- Russia -> Every russian plane\tank is overpowered, I litterally got bored of playing as US and constatly get shot down by Russia that I tried to play Russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.-Every tank that's not russian seems to have armor made of cardboard, you can literally shoot at least 10 times at a russian tank and you won't do anything to it, then you get destroyed by like 5 machine gun rounds from a russian tank.The usual joke about this game is that it is russian biased, well guess what? IT ♥♥♥♥ING IS!People ofter ask ""Is this game Pay to Win?"" of course it isn't, it's play Russia to win.So, if you don't like to loose, Grab your Sekrit Dokumints, put on your tracksuit and your Ushanka, choose your Russian plane made of Stalinium and spam &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" everywhere you can and put on ""Kalinka"" or The russian march of Red Alert 2, oh, don't forget to write  ""xaxaxaxaxaxa ))))))"" after every kill. Now that you know how to play Russia in WT, you're ready to go Tovarish.",0
